Now, that program is at risk. As a teen, Sparks knew he wanted to go to college and become a teacher. But growing up in rural Kentucky in a low-income household without role models who had attended college, he didn’t know where to start. He found the help he needed in the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) initiative. Through the program, Sparks connected with mentors who helped him learn about financial aid, how to fill out a FAFSA form and how to look through a college course catalog. States, colleges, school districts and community organizations apply for federal money to support this work with students like him each year. Sparks graduated from high school — something his grandfather, who helped raise him, never did — attended college and went on to earn multiple graduate degrees, including his doctoral degree. “There’s almost an unofficial playbook about how to make it through college financially, academically — all these things,” said Sparks, who now teaches statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles and helps young Kentuckians find their path toward higher education. “And without those resources, I had no idea about how to make that happen.” Nationwide, more than 568,000 low-income students were enrolled in the GEAR UP program in the 2022-23 school year, according to the National Council for Community and Education Partnerships. But under the Trump administration’s 2026 proposed budget for the Department of Education, this program would be eliminated. ““The GEAR Up Program has accomplished what it set out to do – help students prepare and enroll in college,” said Ellen Keast, a Department of Education spokesperson, in a written statement to PBS News. “Through access to federal student aid, states and institutions of higher education have the ability to continue these programs.” The Department of Education distributes grants and loans like GEAR UP to the nation’s schools and students for a wide variety of support programs, for elementary to college students and beyond. But the department has become a target for the Trump administration’s goal of slimming the federal government. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly 2,000 employees were laid off that month, including those responsible for fielding complaints about federal student loans, training state and district officials on how to secure and comply with competitive federal grants, and monitoring data for trends in graduation rates and student need nationwide. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked Trump’s order with a preliminary injunction following a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by multiple school districts and education groups, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun ordered the federal agency to reinstate its fired workers. A department spokesperson told PBS News that the administration plans to immediately challenge the judge’s ruling. “President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,” Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, said in a written statement. Some workers who have been fired outright or have been placed on administrative leave say the cuts make it harder to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on education in the ways Congress intended and will make it harder for local communities and states to support students or plan for the future. Education research scientist Joseph Murphy was on a team of six people that tracked data tied to federal grants designed to help the nation’s students and communities with the highest needs. They collected and analyzed data from all U.S. states and territories and assisted with quality control, making sure services, such as how many elementary students needed an aide to help them read, were counted the same way across the country. Murphy sees the elimination of his team as “a complete purge of anything data-related.” “This is an open war on data – on anybody who has truth and facts and figures to back up what they’re saying, to prove the folks that were saying that the education system is a mess, to prove them wrong,” he said. People do not really understand what the federal government does and what cuts to the Education Department or its services mean, Murphy said. Different states and school districts rely on federal dollars by varying degrees. For decades, the government has relied on data to determine where needs are greatest and if those dollars generated results. Murphy is unsure whether that data can be collected for the upcoming academic year or if anyone will be in place to understand and evaluate it. Without reliable data to track federal funding and their associated outcomes, Murphy does not know how those decisions will be made — if at all. Taken together, Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy, said these changes will erode the ability to determine how the nation overall is performing in the classroom, what should be done differently and how to reach those goals. “President Trump and his supporters do not think we should have a national vision for education, that there shouldn’t be a body that’s empowered to do things like collect data on performance of students,” he said. “‘Increasingly, we end up flying blind.” What the Education Department does The Department of Education became a Cabinet-level department in 1979. For decades, Congress has passed laws to govern how those dollars would be distributed to communities. Moynihan said while the department does not provide teachers, it sets standards and collects data to track if those standards are being met across the country, monitoring for disparities. “While regulations can be cumbersome, they’re there to make sure people’s tax dollars are used according to the will of Congress and that everyone is a good steward,” said David Downey, a former management analyst at the department who trained more than 100,000 people on how to apply for and manage federal grants, including the GEAR UP program. Since the Reagan administration, presidents have threatened to get rid of the Department of Education, but hadn’t because “we collectively assumed this was a congressional responsibility,” Moynihan said. Today, the Trump administration argues that states can do a better job than the department of serving the needs of students and families. But in South Bend, Indiana, school administrator Chad Addie says a federal grant has changed the face of education in his city over the last four years. The GEAR UP initiative allowed educators and business leaders to introduce more than 2,300 students to emerging job and college opportunities in Addie’s district alone. Looking at the students this program helps daily, Addie said the work is far from over. “There are students right now who are counting on us because this is their moment in high school, this is their moment in middle school, and it’s important that we’re responsive in this moment for those students,” Addie said. What comes next? Murphy’s administrative leave is scheduled to end in June, and he does not know what he is going to do next. He is very concerned about the students, educators and school districts across the country that will need to scramble to fill budget holes to avoid laying off teachers or losing services without those federal dollars. When Murphy was put on administrative leave, he was unable to access his work email and had to turn over his badge and office computer. Many department employees lost their email access so quickly, they were unable to notify colleagues in state offices and school districts who they had been working with. Months later, no one has contacted him about transitioning his work to a different person or office. Following the federal judge’s injunction against the Trump administration to stop its efforts to eliminate the Department of Education, federal human resources officials said in court documents that they had contacted all employees through personal e-mail about notice and copies of the May 22 court order. Murphy said no department officials had contacted him with updates about his employment status. “But did anyone expect them to?” Murphy asked. For Downey, the court’s decision “is a win for ED staff, but it might take a while for folks to see and feel it.” That includes him. Filing for early retirement and the department’s fate uncertain, Downey said his paperwork must be received by June 9. “The clock is ticking against many of us even with the good news.” In California, Superintendent Mike Matsuda leads Anaheim Union High School District, where roughly 4 in 5 students qualify for free or reduced meals, he said. He says his biggest challenge right now “is the ambiguity and the uncertainty around budgeting.” The district, home to 25,000 students, risks losing a tenth of its $425 million annual budget if federal funding for services such as professional development and English-language instruction goes away. Matsuda said this crunch comes at a strategically terrible time, when high school students are entering a job market disrupted by rapidly evolving technology, including artificial intelligence. Anticipating what these changes could mean for students whose families do not have money to fill in the gaps left by possible funding cuts, Sparks said if federal programs like GEAR UP are zeroed, “the opportunities go away.” “When those programs are gone, that route is not even gravel road. They have to pave their own route. When you hit a bump in the road, you don’t know if that’s the end or if you should keep going,” Sparks said. “Children coming from homes that are impoverished should not be penalized more for not having that social safety net.” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

By — Laura Santhanam Laura Santhanam Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/researchers-warn-u-s-is-on-the-precipice-of-brain-drain-as-trump-cuts-federal-grants Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Researchers warn U.S. is on the ‘precipice’ of brain drain as Trump cuts federal grants Health Jun 16, 2025 6:00 AM EDT Detecting tuberculosis can be tricky. The time between getting infected and presenting with symptoms can span months or even years. To trace this contagious disease, Melanie Chitwood, a postdoctoral associate who studies the epidemiology of microbial diseases, worked with colleagues at Yale University to sequence the bacteria’s genomic data, using that as a signal to detect transmission. Generations ago, public health workers in the United States had snuffed out most tuberculosis transmission. To study this illness Chitwood’s team collected samples for more than a decade from places where the disease is more common, including Moldova and Malawi. Their work has contributed to understanding how to get one step ahead of the disease. But now, the federal grant funding that had supported Chitwood’s yearslong research is gone. Weeks after President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, his administration began to cancel grants to reduce what it called “fraud, waste and abuse.” Researchers who pursued anything that appeared to contradict his agenda in global health, race, gender identity, climate change and topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion saw their grants terminated. READ MORE: What happens to health research when ‘women’ and ‘diversity’ are banned words? Chitwood said “it’s starting to feel like the walls are closing in” as opportunities to continue her research in the United States disappear. Like a growing number of scientists and experts, Chitwood is asking herself if she needs to pursue her research outside the country. “It feels like I need to either change what I do or change where I do it,” Chitwood said. “Neither of those options are pleasant.” The administration’s cuts to federal funding and hiring freezes at colleges and universities come at a crucial time. While cures exist for tuberculosis, public health experts are concerned those tools could be losing their edge. Evidence shows the bacteria that causes the disease is increasingly resistant to antibiotics that were once effective treatments. Cases of tuberculosis are reported occasionally in the U.S., where a century ago, it was a leading cause of death. For nearly three decades, the disease’s prevalence has fallen, but that is changing. Last year, more than 10,000 U.S. cases of tuberculosis were confirmed, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking an increase over recent years. As U.S. funding dries up, some researchers told PBS News life-saving answers are at risk of slipping through their fingers. Experts face a ‘blitzkrieg against science’ Throughout history, intellectuals have found themselves considering whether to flee a hostile environment. Before World War II, physicist Albert Einstein, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and other scientists fled Europe to escape persecution and death during the Holocaust, finding refuge in the United States. Purges also consumed the educated class in the Soviet Union and Cambodia in the 20th century. Once in the United States, the work of these refugees contributed to the nation’s post-war prosperity and helped make it a global leader in innovation, said Robert N. Proctor, a science historian at Stanford University. U.S. investments in research, he said, are “really the seed corn of future knowledge.” Trump’s targeting of intellectuals will disrupt more than grant cycles, Proctor added, upending scientific infrastructure that took decades to build only to usher in “the golden age of ignorance.” “It really is a blitzkrieg against science,” he said. So far this year, roughly 2,400 grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been terminated, according to Grant Watch, a project that has worked to chronicle the Trump administration’s efforts to slash research funding. Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included “hiv,” “biomedical,” “risk” and “disparities.” READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump’s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, “We will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.” He added that the administration would “eliminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.” When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. “We have!” DeLauro shot back. Since Trump’s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe’s World War II-era “brain drain,” including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. “There are real and lasting consequences here,” she said. “We’re standing on the precipice of that.” Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. “This is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,” Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many “idealistic people who want to change the world” will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. “I will be able to weather the storm,” he said. “I’m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.” Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. “If the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?” she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

            "‘They're the backbone’: Trump’s targeting of legal immigrants threatens health sector. ‘They’re the backbone’: Trump’s targeting of legal immigrants threatens health sector\nFederal policy changes are having spillover effects on everything from disease outbreak mitigation to long-term care\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to strip protections from more than half a million legal immigrants could devastate the health sector, endangering care for the elderly and worsening rates of both chronic and infectious diseases.\nHundreds of thousands of health care workers, including an estimated 30,000 legal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, are at risk of being deported — worrying providers and patients who rely on them for everything from nursing and physical therapy to maintenance, janitorial, foodservice and housekeeping work.\nGoodwin Living, a faith-based, not-for-profit elder care complex just across the Potomac River from D.C., is poised to lose 65 staff members following Supreme Court rulings on Friday and earlier in May that gave the Trump administration permission to terminate humanitarian parole and temporary protected status issued by prior presidents to migrants from several countries plagued by poverty and violence.\n“I just can’t even imagine the impact it would have on those of us that are cared for on a daily basis if we were to suddenly lose them,” said Jill Miller, who has resided at Goodwin Living for eight years with her husband Carl. “They’re the backbone.”\nGoodwin Living is one of hundreds of long-term care facilities around the country that employ immigrants whose legal status will soon end, and its leaders have joined a chorus of providers from Florida to California warning that the Trump administration’s crackdown will decimate care capacity and facilitate the spread of communicable diseases, putting U.S. citizens at risk.\nThese vulnerabilities underscore the precarity of the nation’s patchwork immigration system. Immigrants — both documented and undocumented — make up a disproportionate share of the health care workforce, particularly in areas like long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities, and their expulsion would make existing shortages much worse.\nYet Congress’ decades-long inability to enact permanent fixes has left millions dependent on executive actions and discretionary programs that can be upended every time a new administration takes power — a situation people on all sides of the immigration debate agree is unsustainable.\nEven conservatives who favor President Donald Trump’s decision to end humanitarian parole and temporary protected status acknowledge that doing so could harm several sectors of the economy — including agriculture and construction in addition to health care — but they argue the Biden administration misused those programs as a backdoor means of ushering in more permanent migration.\n“There are valid concerns, absolutely,” said Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “But the solution we need is for Congress to determine what level of immigration we need, what skill level we need, what the conditions are, and then to pass laws. You can’t just completely bypass Congress with executive action on immigration and expect this fragile edifice that we set up to survive.”\nThe administration, meanwhile, dismisses the health industry’s concerns.\n“The assertion that the only way we can take care of our seniors is by allowing unvetted illegal aliens and foreigners with criminal records to remain in the country is grossly false and lazy,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to POLITICO. “If people want to come to our country to be caregivers for our seniors, they need to do that by coming here the legal way.”\nWhen asked specifically about workers with temporary protected status and humanitarian parole — who entered the country legally after being vetted and sponsored — the agency did not respond. Past presidents have extended legal protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of immigrants under those programs because they face dangerous conditions in their home countries.\nThe Trump administration is simultaneously ramping up enforcement, including in formerly off-limits spaces like hospitals and clinics. That’s causing immigrants and their citizen relatives to avoid all kinds of medical care — from testing and treatment for infectious diseases to preventive care for chronic conditions like diabetes, driving up costs for taxpayers and threatening public health more broadly.\n“If they’re afraid to even go to work or send their kids to school, they’re certainly afraid to come to doctors’ visits,” said Sandy Reding, an emergency room nurse in Bakersfield and the president of the California Nurses Association. “They’re not seeking medical attention when they should, and we’re seeing time and time again that those delays in care are making things worse.”\nReding said an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity targeting her area’s large population of migrant farmworkers has caused many to avoid care for conditions like diabetes and elevated blood pressure — leading to preventable amputations or strokes.\n“And when it comes to things like measles and bird flu that are easily spread, it poses a threat to the whole community,” she said.\n‘The quality of care will be poor’\nA study published in the medical journal JAMA in April calculated that about a million non-citizen immigrants work in health care, including more than 366,500 who are undocumented. And no sector of the sprawling health care system would be harder hit by mass deportations than long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities — where immigrants make up nearly 30 percent of the direct care workforce.\nIn an amicus brief opposing the Trump administration’s bid to cancel humanitarian parole for half a million workers, the attorneys general for 15 states and Washington, D.C. noted that immigrants make up more than three quarters of home health aides in New York and nearly half in California.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to begin deporting about a half-million immigrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole programs implemented during the Biden administration. The decision came less than two weeks after the justices granted another immigration-related emergency request from the administration, allowing officials to end temporary protected status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans.\nGiven already severe shortages of workers for typically low-paid and challenging care economy jobs, and a looming spike in demand for long-term care services as Baby Boomers age, the elder care industry is warning of an impending crisis.\nRob Liebreich, the CEO of Goodwin Living, worries he may have to accept fewer residents and cut back services if his workers are deported. Reducing the supply of long-term care workers amid increasing demand will also drive up the cost of services as facilities compete for those who remain, he said. That, in turn, could force more aging Americans to depend on untrained family members as caregivers, which then pulls those people out of the paid workforce.\n“It’ll be a real drain on the overall economy,” he said. “But more importantly, I just don’t want to let down the current American older adult population, and we’re absolutely going to let them down by not having enough hands to provide the services and support that they deserve and expect.”\nLeadingAge — an advocacy group representing thousands of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospice programs and retirement homes around the country — echoed Liebreich’s fears in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security in April, pleading with the agency to reconsider ending the parole program. They did not receive a response.\nThe Trump administration acknowledged some of these concerns in its March executive order canceling humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, noting that there will be repercussions both for the individuals and their employers. Still, the order argued, both the immigrants and their employers knew that the protections were temporary and subject to the discretion of the federal government, and they should have applied for more permanent status.\nLiebreich said that while Goodwin Living has helped over 200 workers become citizens over the past decade and has set up the 65 currently at risk to meet with immigration attorneys, the Trump administration is closing off many of the other programs they would have been eligible for — like temporary protected status — and not giving them enough time to navigate the process.\n“They thought they had two years to work with, not mere months,” he said.\nSaudatu Savage, a registered nurse at Goodwin Living who came as a refugee from Sierra Leone more than two decades ago and is now a U.S. citizen, said it will make her job much harder if dozens of her coworkers are forced to leave.\n“It’s going to be a disaster,” she said. “There are not a lot of nurses out there, and there are going to be more and more patients. So it will be a burden on us and it’s going to affect the whole health care system, and I fear the quality of care will be poor.”\nWith the workers’ status in limbo, even some staunch conservatives are warning of negative ramifications of the administration’s crackdown, and are calling instead for an increase in visas for immigrants to work in health care.\n“You can’t just do across-the-board reductions and not have real challenges in areas where vital workers exist, especially in health care,” said Tom Price, a former GOP congressman who served as the health secretary during Trump’s first term and now works as a consultant. “If you just have across-the-board reductions, it will harm our ability to continue to provide care for folks at all different levels, whether it’s acute or chronic care.”\n‘Measles doesn’t care about your immigration status’\nWhen measles erupted among children in Minneapolis’ large Somali community in May 2024, the city contracted with groups that work with the area’s Somali, Hmong, Latin American and Native American populations, set up free vaccine clinics in their neighborhoods run by trusted community groups, deployed contact tracers, and produced videos in multiple languages urging vaccinations.\nA few months later, after identifying 52 cases and hospitalizing 12 people, they had it under control.\nBut local officials fear that now, amid the biggest measles outbreak the U.S. has seen in decades, including a few cases in Minnesota, they may not be as successful.\nHealth care providers in Minneapolis and around the country are reporting that since Trump took office and changed federal policy to allow immigration enforcement agents to detain people in hospitals and clinics, immigrants with and without documents are avoiding health services, including testing and treatment for infectious diseases and vaccinations.\n“When people feel threatened, there’s a chilling effect,” said Michelle Rivero, the director of the city’s Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs, which was founded during the first Trump administration. “There is a greater sense of fear and anxiety with regard to accessing health care.”\nThat chilling effect will be compounded, local officials warn, by the Trump administration’s cuts to public health funding, which have forced the Minneapolis Public Health Department to shut down several vaccine clinics and end contracts with three community health organizations that were crucial in halting the 2024 measles outbreak: MHealth Fairview, Odam Medical Clinic, and Neighborhood HealthSource. The state’s health department in April sent layoff and separation notices to 170 employees because of the funding cuts. Those employees worked in several areas including the state’s response to measles.\nThe administration argued the funding should be cut because Congress had appropriated it to combat Covid-19 and the pandemic is over — though health departments around the country had been using the money to shore up defenses against other infectious diseases. Though a judge blocked the cuts from taking effect, that ruling could be overturned on appeal.\nAt a time when immigrant groups’ already high distrust of government is even higher due to fears of immigration enforcement, said Deputy Health Commissioner Heidi Ritchie, public health departments won’t be successful if they can’t contract with non-governmental community groups to do outreach and provide services.\n“With the loss of those contracts, we can’t be confident that we’re able to serve a population when there’s another measles outbreak,” she said. “Measles doesn’t care about your immigration status or your ethnicity. But when we are providing these clinics, they’re free, and they are in community spaces that people already have trust with.”\nUnder pressure from the Trump administration, several states including Minnesota and California are also rolling back programs that provide health insurance to undocumented immigrants, putting testing and treatment for infectious diseases further out of reach.\nIn addition to measles, public health leaders are concerned about the impact of Trump’s immigration policies on efforts to combat tuberculosis — a bacterial infection the U.S. nearly eradicated decades ago that is now resurging from Kansas City to Los Angeles.\n“People are, all of a sudden, a little bit leery of presenting themselves in congregate settings where they might be targets for enforcement,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “It really is emanating out of a greater fear of those places being actively monitored by ICE.”\nThe Trump administration and advocacy groups that want to restrict immigration say higher levels of tuberculosis in immigrant communities justifies turning people away at the border. But Freeman and other experts stress that while the infections are more prevalent in those communities, it has nothing to do with their country of origin and everything to do with crowded living conditions and a lack of access to vaccines, which is why TB outbreaks are also common in U.S. homeless shelters and prisons. By implementing policies that deter immigrants from seeking health services, she argued, the Trump administration could make the situation worse.\n“We are worried, from a public health standpoint, that people will tie tuberculosis outbreaks to immigrant communities unfairly and traumatize those groups even more,” Freeman said. “We were fearful that it might be used by the administration to say, ‘This is a disease they bring in. We’ve got to get them out of the country.’”\nTo reach those fearful of coming in for services, some public health departments are ramping up telehealth services, while others are creating mobile units so that immigrants don’t have to leave their neighborhoods. Still others are posting know-your-rights information in multiple languages for their patients, and coaching providers on what to do in the event of a raid.\n“Our union has trained us on what to do if ICE comes into our hospitals,” said the California Nurses Association’s Reding. “We’ve always been patient advocates but right now the need for that is even stronger.”\nYet both research and anecdotal reports suggest that the health care repercussions of restrictive immigration policies can extend beyond their target populations and linger long after the policies themselves are lifted.\nA 2021 study found that the “public charge” rule in the first Trump administration — which penalized legal immigrants who used government safety net programs — led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, researchers found.\nAnother study, published in 2022, found that legal immigrants without green cards were still avoiding care more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.\n“We’ve created fear and distrust of the health care system in the immigrant community even without enforcement,” said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “This has big implications, including for mixed status households and U.S. citizen children, and it could be both costly and fatal.”",

(Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)\nAn addicted man pricks his finger to test himself for HIV and hepatitis at a mobile health clinic in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)\nNEW ORLEANS – Every morning, to avoid getting sick, Jessica Baudean must take a long trip across the Mississippi. Baudean, who is disabled, lived in a tent near Tchoupitoulas Street until she received housing support in 2022, and now lives with her partner in an apartment in Avondale.\nBeaudean and her partner, Terry Asevado, are methadone patients. Once heroin users, they now take a prescribed daily dose of methadone – a synthetic opioid medication which relieves them of their withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Baudean and Asevado say it’s changed their lives and allowed them to function.\nBut to get the medication, the couple must travel for hours every day. If they can’t get a ride through Medicaid, Baudean must climb into her wheelchair and have Asevado push her 1.4 miles to the nearest bus stop. Then they spend an hour taking two buses,crossing the river to reach the only clinic on the city’s East Bank which is allowed to give them their medicine. If they arrive even a minute past noon, they miss their dose. If they miss a dose, they may be denied the next one. And if they’re arrested?\n“Poor Terry,” sighs Baudean. “I know he’s still going to be sick right now.”\nAs the Trump administration cracks down on immigrants and hikes tariffs on Mexican imports, largely in the name of fighting the fentanyl crisis, a look at the experience of local people wrestling with substance use disorder suggests different approaches could be more effective.\nLouisiana has among the highest overdose death rates nationwide. It’s also embattled by repeated disasters, internal migration and displacement, and poor public health support. And examples of effective drug policy under similar pressures can be found in a surprising place, far from the Gulf South: Ukraine.\nPrison here, prison there\nIn a corridor within Strizhavka Detention Center, a medium-security prison complex in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, Iana Romaniuk smacks the glowing blue button of a vending machine. Inside, a sterile syringe tumbles to the bottom.\n“There are clean needles, lubricants and condoms” – and no cameras, explains Romaniuk, who works with Free Zone, an organization providing harm reduction services in Ukrainian prisons.\n“It’s new, installed 10 days ago,” she adds, with a hint of pride.\nRomaniuk, an unassuming woman with glasses and straight brown hair, spends her days advocating for the men in this sprawling prison complex and attached hospital. Though far from the frontlines, the specter of war hangs overhead. Security guards forbid photos of an old sign written in Russian, the language of their invaders.\nThe vending machine at the facility in central Ukraine is just part of one of the world’s most effective harm reduction networks, still going – and growing – after three years of war.\nHarm reduction is a public health approach that emphasizes minimizing the negative physical and social impacts of risky behavior. It aims to inform and support, rather than punish, drug users. It can mean supplying clean needles and naloxone, which can reverse an overdose. And it involves testing for HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other diseases.\nIn Strizhavka, about 3½ hours southeast of Kyiv, more than 25% of the 400 inmates receive opioid substitution therapy, or OST, just like Baudean and Asevado back in Louisiana. Here, a doctor distributes it in tiny paper cups from a pump bottle.\nSince the prison began offering inmates free, clean syringes, it has seen zero new HIV cases. The prison even has a program that trains interested inmates to be social workers. Trained inmates support their incarcerated peers and can potentially work in addiction recovery after their release.\nThe radically different approach is striking because, though 5,000 miles apart, Ukraine and Louisiana wrestle with similar public health challenges. Ukraine has among the highest HIV and intravenous drug use rates in Europe, trailing only Russia. Louisiana has the fourth highest HIV rate in the U.S., the fifth highest rate for drug overdose mortality and disproportionately high levels of hepatitis C, a viral infection commonly spread through sharing needles.\n“Louisiana is very unique with its positioning,” said Ellis Lee, a former employee of New Orleans’ Syringe Access Program (NOSAP) at Crescent Care. “We have so many viral illnesses, historically, in part because we’re a port city.”\nTo grapple with the crisis, Louisiana has made some policy updates in recent years. New Orleans’ City Council decriminalized fentanyl test strips in 2021, and Narcan has helped slow overdose deaths. But drug policy in the U.S. South – and in Russia – has remained largely punitive, while Ukraine’s has grown steadily more progressive – partly in reaction to Russia’s approach.\nThe contrasts are many. Hypodermic needle exchanges exist all over Ukraine and are rapidly expanding. In Louisiana, needle exchanges are only allowed in East Baton Rouge Parish, New Orleans, Shreveport and Alexandria. NOSAP is the Gulf South’s largest needle exchange, serving over 2000 people in six months. There are no syringe exchanges in Louisiana prisons.\nThe results speak for themselves. Before the war, Ukraine had seen an 81% reduction in AIDS mortality since 2010, according to the Ukrainiain Public Health Center, and drug overdose rates fell in 2021.\nMeanwhile, drug overdoses in Louisiana rates more than quintupled between 2017 and 2022 – from 401 to 2,376 – and hepatitis C infections are increasing, based on numbers from the state health department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSince the war began in February 2022, Ukraine’s harm reduction networks have successfully pushed the government to expand services in light of the crisis. That’s partly how, as one incarcerated person put it, “civilization came to this place.”\n‘The best way to torture somebody’\nBeaudean’s partner, Terry Asevado, was arrested this spring in Jefferson Parish for bringing contraband into a correctional center. He’s still in jail because they can’t afford his $10,000 bail. Baudean said she knows he’s suffering because the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office does not facilitate prescribed methadone for people in jail. Baudean remembers a time she was arrested and cut off from her medication.\n“I wanted to kill myself, straight up, but I didn’t have the guts to do it,” she recalls.\nBaudean remembers weeks of sleeplessness, being unable to hold down food or water, throwing up bile, finding all noise excruciating.\n“It’s the best way to torture somebody. Get them addicted to some stuff, and then put them in a room and lock it.”\nFederal and state regulations permit jailed patients to receive methadone, but parishes would need to coordinate with the local methadone clinic to do so, according to Traci Perry, Louisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority. Gretna’s methadone clinic is run by Behavioral Health Group. They say they’ve never been contacted by Jefferson Parish Corrections, nor by CorrectHealth, the company that provides medical services for the jail.\n“We would look forward to the opportunity to begin a relationship with them, so they can best serve our patients,” said Michelle Peres-Tenorio, BHG’s program director.\nMost correctional facilities bring in an outside contractor to provide medication-assisted treatment services, Peres-Tenoria added. The treatment typically involves a non-methadone medication for “a very limited amount of days,” followed by only over-the-counter medication, she said. “The staff is typically not educated on methadone treatment.”\nA JPSO public information officer told the Illuminator the department has no policy on the matter and referred questions to CorrectHealth, which did not respond to queries.\nMobile outreach testing\nHarm reduction also entails making sure people can get testing and treatment for illnesses associated with drug use. That’s why, inside a van parked near a Kyiv methadone clinic, behind sheer peach-colored curtains, Mykolai, an addicted man who declined to share his last name, folded himself into a seat at a tiny plastic table. Leaning in, Valeriy Timoshenko, a social worker with the Ukrainian harm reduction organization Convictus, helped him prick his finger. Mykolai pinched a plastic dropper to carefully take a few drops of blood, releasing them onto two HIV and hepatitis testing strips laid out before him.\n“You’re living with a partner, so I can give you one to take home,” Timoshenko told him. The results of the tests – HIV and hepatitis – take a few minutes to appear. “If your results are positive, I will describe where you should go to get free treatment.”\nMykolai, a 38-year-old former landscaper, handed Timoshenko a card. Printed on the card is a QR code that Timoshenko can scan to see how often Mykolai has gotten tested and some of his medical history. The card also qualifies Mykolai to receive a small payment – 100 Ukrainian hryvnia, equal to about $2.40 – for being tested. Mykolai also got five cards to hand out to friends, slowly building a kind of self-testing network.\nMykolai looked down, his expression neutral. The HIV test was negative, but he’d tested positive for hepatitis C.\nLouisiana does have some mobile outreach testing units. Some groups, like Below Sea Level Aid, also offer incentives when they can. But while Ukrainian police are forbidden from approaching the clinic or Timoshenko’s van, “police used to stake out NOSAP,” said Below Sea Level Aid founder Jack Waguespack, which he said deters the group from parking its testing unit outside clinics.\nWar, storms, and displacement\nAlready, there has been some exchange of expertise between Ukraine and Louisiana.\nOn a February afternoon, Velta Parkhomenko, project manager of the NGO Club Eney, a woman-focused harm reduction organization in Kyiv, sat before a screen as chatter from a sobriety meeting filtered in from the next room. Parkhomenko and another Ukrainian harm reduction worker were meeting online with two of their peers from Louisiana, who asked their names not be disclosed for fear of reprisal at their workplace. Talking excitedly through the screens, they ticked through some policy differences in their respective homes.\nPerhaps the biggest: prescription parity.\nIn Ukraine, where about 20,000 people receive opioid substitution treatment, patients can go to government or private clinics for methadone prescriptions, get them filled at any pharmacy, and then take home a 10-day supply. Thanks to advocacy efforts, patients were given 30-day supplies during certain periods of the war.\n“That is not how that works here,” one Louisiana worker said, startled enough to laugh. Patients “have to fight really hard to be able to even just get a seven-day take home” supply, they said.\nMethadone is among the most controlled substances in the U.S., meaning it’s under restrictions that make acquiring it especially difficult for patients. In the event of a natural disaster, it has to be transported to impacted areas under armed guard.\nJust one methadone clinic exists on Orleans Parish’s east bank, serving more than 900 OST patients.\nClinics are meant to hand out extra take-home supply before storms, but adoption of that policy is up to the discretion of clinics, and has not been widespread, according to sources familiar with the issue. During evacuations, there is no protocol in place for ensuring an OST patient has continued access to medication, nor gauging need – unlike, say, dialysis patients.\nLouisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority, part of its state health department, makes decisions about methadone dosing sites and transportation during declared emergencies, which then require approval from federal officials.\nThe divergence in policy is notable since Ukraine and Louisiana are both deeply familiar with displacement and evacuations.\nSitting in her office in a quiet apartment block in Kyiv, Tatiana Lebid wears a pink headband and sparkling eye shadow. She’s the founder of VONA, an organization for women who use drugs, as well as a recovering addict.\nShe lists the effects of the war on her country, many of which will sound familiar to those who lived through Hurricane Katrina and other major storms: post-traumatic stress disorder, the destruction of medical facilities, a “brain drain” that’s reduced the number of health care workers, and a spike in domestic violence. Lost documents, displacement, unemployment and increased police encounters with curfews in effect are also commonplace, she said.\nLebid herself was shaken last year when a drone dropped bombs just behind her apartment block. She recalled leaning out her window to try and see the damage, certain the bomb had destroyed her car. It was spared, but she has felt the fear that has driven millions to flee Ukraine.\nA major part of VONA’s work is to ensure people forced to flee can continue receiving treatment and support. They help Ukrainians replace lost identification documents and refer users to nearby OST clinics using a simple tool: a telephone hotline.\nLebid’s colleagues field calls from every region in the country, from prisons, and even from Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines. OST recipients were exempt from being conscripted into the military until March 2024, though some still are not draft eligible because of their HIV or tuberculosis status.\nBodhan Protsenko, manning the phones, says the beginning of war saw a dramatic uptick in calls: 50-70 per day, up from eight before the war, he said.\nProtsenko pays special attention to the soldiers’ calls. He served a year and a half on the frontline and knows how hard it can be. Lately, he’s seen an uptick in soldiers using opiates. He isn’t surprised – the drugs can help with stress and sleep, he said.\n‘I understand how to do this in a smart way’\nBack in Strizhavka, Romaniuk leaves the vending machine behind and enters a small office. Yellow light falls over the wallpaper. Outside, an inmate chops firewood.\nAdvocates say prisons are where the need for harm reduction services, like clean needles, are most needed. Syringes on the black market can cost a hundred times more what they cost outside prison, which leads to reuse and illness. HIV rates are 25 times higher for the incarcerated.\nNeedle exchange programs in Ukraine count more than 900 incarcerated clients and some 20,000 syringes replaced as of this spring. Before beginning its exchange program a year ago, the Strizhavka prison used to see a handful of new HIV cases each year. This year, they’ve seen none.\nOleksandr Lushnia, sitting against the wall and smiling shyly, is one of the prison’s incarcerated people who’ve been trained as addiction social workers. A former construction worker, he was put in prison about three years ago for stealing a bicycle.\n“Before this program, people could take dirty needles from trash bins – broken, dirty needles. Or they’d pay money to get clean needles, which meant they had to do different harmful things,” Lushnia said. “Now, people get infections less. I feel good. I understand how to do this [manage addiction] in a smart way, and tell other people how to.”\nLushnia took eight lessons in social work over one month, and was trained in how to administer Narcan and treat overdoses. He hopes to continue working in addiction recovery once released. Out of more than 400 inmates trained through the program, 77 have become certified social workers within the prison program.\nAnd the war has only spurred Ukraine to bolster its efforts.\nIn fall 2022, Russian forces entered and occupied the southern city of Kherson, including the prisons there. Soldiers cut off OST, which is banned in Russia, for all inmates – then flaunted the decision on Russian state media.\nIn response, Ukraine stood firm – and in fact further expanded OST services, from three prisons to 10, now serving more than 500 people.\nNow, there are fears U.S. policy on opioid addiction treatment could become more regressive under the Trump administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has talked about “healing farms” or work camps for people with addiction, similar to the system once used in Soviet Russia.\nBaudean would like to see Louisiana, instead, draw some lessons from Ukraine – like having more clinics, staffed by more counselors with lived experience of addiction, like Parkhomenko. There are formerly addicted people “that really changed their life, and they did the right thing and turned it around,” says Baudean. “So why don’t we hire the ones that did, to teach the ones that can’t?”\nThis reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Women on the Ground: Reporting from Ukraine’s Unseen Frontlines Initiative in partnership with the Howard G.

            "HIV protection with just two shots a year: FDA approves Gilead drug. The Food and Drug Administration approved Wednesday a powerful new drug that provides nearly complete protection against HIV infection with just a single administration every six months.\nThe injection, known chemically as lenacapavir and to be marketed as Yeztugo, has been hailed as the closest thing the field has ever had to a vaccine — a groundbreaking intervention that, if rolled out properly, could bring a 45-year-old pandemic to heel. Drugs to prevent HIV, called PrEP, have been around for a decade, but they generally require taking a daily pill and have not substantially curbed global infections.\n“It really could be a game changer, particularly in areas heavily affected by HIV,” said John Brooks, former chief medical officer of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of HIV prevention.\nYet excitement among advocates and researchers has dimmed since the first data came out last year — not over the drug, but over the climate in which it will be released. The Trump administration has eviscerated federal support for HIV treatment and prevention overseas and cut public health and HIV prevention programs in the U.S. Some of the domestic cuts were rolled back in the past week, but the administration is still proposing a significant cut to HIV work in next year’s budget.\nThose moves have raised doubts about how broadly Yeztugo will reach populations most in need both in the U.S. and around the world. Linda-Gail Bekker, a South African researcher who led one of the two pivotal trials, said she now feared it could be a couple of years before the drug is rolled out in her country and others.\nMeanwhile, infections may rise as patients and at-risk individuals lose medicines and services they received through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which was credited with saving 26 million lives before the Administration froze much of its funding.\n“It’s tragic beyond belief if that’s the way it plays out,” said Bekker, Deputy Director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in Cape Town.\nGilead did not immediately disclose a price for the drug. ViiV charges around $4,000 per injection for its once-every-two-month drug Apretude.\nIn the U.S., the hope is the drug can both provide a more convenient option for existing PrEP users and also attract people who have been unable to or faced challenges adhering to a daily pill.\nOne challenge for both the company and providers will be getting insurers to pay for a pricey brand-name medicine when a generic is available. Truvada, a pill that had been a huge seller for Gilead, has been off-patent since 2021. Analysts and clinicians expect insurers will impose hurdles, such as requiring patients to try a generic first.\nJared Beatan, Gilead’s vice president of HIV clinical development, characterized the price as “generally in line” with other PrEP drugs while “recognizing the value in the innovation.” He said the company expects 90% of insured Americans will have coverage within a year, while access programs help people obtain medicine if they are uninsured or waiting for coverage to come through.\nThe Foster City, Calif., company has a lot riding on getting the medicine used as widely as possible in the U.S. and Europe. An HIV powerhouse for decades, Gilead has spent over $40 billion since 2019 trying to acquire and develop drugs for cancer and autoimmune diseases, with middling results. “Investors certainly complain that they haven’t got a lot to show for all the money they spent,” said Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird.\nYeztugo is the only drug poised to grow the company, with Wall Street projecting Gilead will earn $3.2 billion annually from the drug by 2030. Today, around 500,000 people in the U.S. take some form of PrEP, out of around 2.2 million the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates may benefit from the drug. Gilead said it would like to push that number to 1 million by 2030.\n“We believe at Gilead, that lenacapavir is potentially the best tool we’ve had yet to end the epidemic,” CEO Dan O’Day said in an interview.\nNext best thing to a vaccine\nIn 1984, Margaret Heckler, Ronald Reagan’s Health Secretary, stood at a Washington podium and announced researchers had identified the virus that causes AIDS. A vaccine, she declared, would be “ready for testing within two years.”\nHeckler’s promise would haunt the field for nearly half a century. HIV proved wilier than any virus humanity had ever encountered. It infects immune cells that try to destroy it. It shapeshifts easily, evading most antibodies. After a string of recent failures, there are today no HIV vaccine candidates even in late-stage trials.\nLenacapavir emerged from left field. Work on the drug began around 20 years ago, when a Gilead researchers tried to build a molecule that could break up HIV’s protective outer shell, called a capsid. The target was considered, in industry parlance, “undruggable.” Each capsid was made of 1,500 parts. How could one tiny molecule interrupt them all?\nIn 2009, the company nearly gave up, as recounted in a recent book. “We were scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas,” Thomas Cihlar, Gilead’s head of virology, recalled. That’s when Cihlar learned of PF74, a capsid-targeting molecule Pfizer abandoned when it shuttered its antiviral work in 2007.\nPF74 was an accelerator. It made the protein shell come together faster. Like in a rushed construction job, the resulting capsid was misformed. PF74 was a weak drug itself. It barely disrupted the virus. And it would be chewed up by the body within minutes. “The molecule was so inherently problematic from the beginning,” said John Link, who directed chemistry work on the drug.\nBut over the course of six years, Gilead chemists tweaked, added and removed atoms to make it more potent and stable, churning through over 4,000 different iterations, until they had a hulking and unusually long-lasting molecule that interferes with the virus on multiple levels. “We’ve had the persistence, right, and commitment,” said Cihlar. “I would say Pfizer didn’t.”\nThe molecule was so stable, Link said, that it’s not metabolized by the liver as virtually all drugs are, and leaves through a slow, alternative mechanism.\nLenacapavir was first approved in 2022 as a treatment for drug-resistant HIV. Last year, two randomized clinical trials, run in South Africa, Uganda, the U.S., Brazil, Thailand, Argentina, Peru and Mexico showed it offered nearly complete protection against HIV with two shots every six months.\nOne of the trials, run in at-risk women and girls, showed it provided far superior protection to a daily PrEP pill, which people often face difficulty or stigma taking. Moreover, it’s not entirely without side effects. The injections can be painful and leave noticeable nodules on the skin.\nYeztugo is now the second long-acting injectable drug to prevent HIV, after ViiV Healthcare’s once-every-two-month injection Apretude. Researchers and analysts expect the twice-yearly injection will prove far more attractive to patients.\n“We don’t have a vaccine, we don’t have any vaccine on the horizon,” said Myron Cohen, “So these are great alternatives.”\nResearchers hope Yeztugo is the latest in a wave of new, long-acting drugs to treat and prevent HIV. Gilead is planning to begin a Phase 3 trial later this year for a once-every-year formulation of lenacapavir. It’s also testing whether lenacapavir, in combination with so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies, can provide a once-every-six-month treatment. A once-a-week pill is also in the works.\nTrump-era hurdles\nScale-up of the drug was supposed to be fast. In October, Gilead signed deals to allow generic manufacturers to produce and sell the drug, royalty free, in 120 low and middle income countries. Because it will take a couple of years for those producers to ramp up production, Gilead announced in December with PEPFAR and The Global Fund to provide doses for 2 million people in those countries over the next three years.\nThe Trump Administration’s slashing of support for PEPFAR has thrown that deal into question. Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier told Reuters last month that, even if PEPFAR pulls out, “our goal is still to meet that objective of 2 million people getting access.” But Baeten declined to provide details on how it planned to do so, if PEPFAR or Global Fund don’t purchase the doses.\n“I think that there’s a lot to be figured out on that,” he said. “But our commitment… is unwavering.”\nIn the U.S., it remains unclear how many PrEP users will want to switch over from daily pills. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams conducted a survey of people currently taking a PrEP medication and found about one-third plan to ask their physician for the Gilead drug or schedule an appointment to discuss it. And another 55% would consider discussing the treatment with their physician.\nHowever, the survey also found that most people who are not currently taking a PrEP medication do not view themselves as sufficiently high risk for HIV or want to take medications, and do not see the shot as meaningfully advantageous compared with pills. Overall, less than 15% of 135 people queried plan to proactively request the drug.\nBut 70% of 560 patients surveyed are aware of lenacapavir, which is quite high for a drug not yet approved, according to Jefferies analyst Michale Yee. “It is encouraging the word is already out there, and increases confidence people will swap given high awareness,” he wrote investors. And 40% of those queried already take a prevention medicine, and nearly all would like to swap within six to 12 months of approval.\nIn short, it may be difficult to truly predict what many patients will do several months from now, but some clinicians are expecting significant demand, including from people who have faced challenges taking daily pills. These include people who are experiencing homelessness or use substances, said Monica Gandhi, Director of the UCSF Center for AIDS Research. “I think they will really benefit,” she said.\nYet there will be notable hurdles to usage. The Trump administration slashed the CDC’s division of HIV prevention in April, including a group that was working on guidance for how providers should use Yeztugo. The administration rolled back those layoffs this month, but it remains unclear how many people were brought back or how the disruptions have impacted the agency’s work.\nCongress is also considering a substantial cut to Medicaid, which provides coverage to 40% of people living with HIV under 65. And the Supreme Court is weighing a case that could lift a requirement that private insurers cover PrEP without a co-pay.\nIn addition, local public health departments are laying off staff who would be involved in outreach, as the Administration moves to cut or rescind funds. Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, just cut 17 workers from its health department.\n“If we remained at the status quo, we would already be facing an uphill battle simply based on the price of the drug,” said Michael Chancley, communications manager of Prep4All and a co-founding member of PrEP in Black America, who lives and works in Atlanta. Now “it’s just going to get that much harder.”\nThe fear is that the drug could, like other PrEP drugs, be most widely used among wealthy and white communities, while remaining out of reach for others at risk. James Krellenstein, managing director of PrEP4All, said he has yet to see a clear plan from Gilead for reaching these groups.\n“Are we going to make the same mistake we made with all the new prep options so far?” said Anu Hazra, director of STI services for the Chicago Center of HIV Elimination.\nOne major challenge will be insurance coverage. Payers may be reluctant to cover an expensive branded drug when generic pills exist.\nAbrahams, the RBC Capital Markets analyst, also recently polled nine pharmacy benefit managers and found that roughly 60% of individuals on PrEP take generic Truvada. All payers, he wrote, are likely to impose so-called step therapy: requiring a patient to try a generic before lenacapavir. Although “potentially surmountable,” these requirements will likely “put a ceiling” on how many patients switch to the new drug in the near-term.\n“This indicates that we will likely continue seeing high generic Truvada use,” he wrote in an investor note, adding, “It is unclear how quickly individuals and their physicians would be able to convince their respective plans that side effects or oral administration of generic Truvada are prohibitive.”\nStill, Hazra is upbeat. Insurers have also imposed hurdles to Apretude, the once-every-two-month injectable, slowing rollout. But his clinic has still been able to give it to over 500 patients. They are preparing procedures for administering lenacapavir, assuming CDC guidance won’t come.\n“Myself and a lot of others are excited,” he said. “In spite of everything going on, this is something to look forward to and something that will make a real impact.”\nMatthew Herper contributed reporting.",

The time between getting infected and presenting with symptoms can span months or even years. To trace this contagious disease, Melanie Chitwood, a postdoctoral associate who studies the epidemiology of microbial diseases, worked with colleagues at Yale University to sequence the bacteria’s genomic data, using that as a signal to detect transmission. Generations ago, public health workers in the United States had snuffed out most tuberculosis transmission. To study this illness Chitwood’s team collected samples for more than a decade from places where the disease is more common, including Moldova and Malawi. Their work has contributed to understanding how to get one step ahead of the disease. But now, the federal grant funding that had supported Chitwood’s yearslong research is gone. Weeks after President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, his administration began to cancel grants to reduce what it called “fraud, waste and abuse.” Researchers who pursued anything that appeared to contradict his agenda in global health, race, gender identity, climate change and topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion saw their grants terminated. READ MORE: What happens to health research when ‘women’ and ‘diversity’ are banned words? Chitwood said “it’s starting to feel like the walls are closing in” as opportunities to continue her research in the United States disappear. Like a growing number of scientists and experts, Chitwood is asking herself if she needs to pursue her research outside the country. “It feels like I need to either change what I do or change where I do it,” Chitwood said. “Neither of those options are pleasant.” The administration’s cuts to federal funding and hiring freezes at colleges and universities come at a crucial time. While cures exist for tuberculosis, public health experts are concerned those tools could be losing their edge. Evidence shows the bacteria that causes the disease is increasingly resistant to antibiotics that were once effective treatments. Cases of tuberculosis are reported occasionally in the U.S., where a century ago, it was a leading cause of death. For nearly three decades, the disease’s prevalence has fallen, but that is changing. Last year, more than 10,000 U.S. cases of tuberculosis were confirmed, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking an increase over recent years. As U.S. funding dries up, some researchers told PBS News life-saving answers are at risk of slipping through their fingers. Experts face a ‘blitzkrieg against science’ Throughout history, intellectuals have found themselves considering whether to flee a hostile environment. Before World War II, physicist Albert Einstein, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and other scientists fled Europe to escape persecution and death during the Holocaust, finding refuge in the United States. Purges also consumed the educated class in the Soviet Union and Cambodia in the 20th century. Once in the United States, the work of these refugees contributed to the nation’s post-war prosperity and helped make it a global leader in innovation, said Robert N. Proctor, a science historian at Stanford University. U.S. investments in research, he said, are “really the seed corn of future knowledge.” Trump’s targeting of intellectuals will disrupt more than grant cycles, Proctor added, upending scientific infrastructure that took decades to build only to usher in “the golden age of ignorance.” “It really is a blitzkrieg against science,” he said. So far this year, roughly 2,400 grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been terminated, according to Grant Watch, a project that has worked to chronicle the Trump administration’s efforts to slash research funding. Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included “hiv,” “biomedical,” “risk” and “disparities.” READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump’s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, “We will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.” He added that the administration would “eliminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.” When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. “We have!” DeLauro shot back. Since Trump’s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe’s World War II-era “brain drain,” including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. “There are real and lasting consequences here,” she said. “We’re standing on the precipice of that.” Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. “This is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,” Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many “idealistic people who want to change the world” will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. “I will be able to weather the storm,” he said. “I’m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.” Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. “If the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?” she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

            "How long can Iran hold under regime-change pressure. RT.com\n08 Jul 2025, 18:19 GMT+10\nThe recent military escalation against Tehran may have ended, but the efforts to remove it as an independent world power persist\nFollowing the launch of a new phase in Israel's military campaign against Iran on June 13, Israeli officials claimed that the strikes had been strictly limited in scope and were aimed solely at neutralizing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.\nThese assertions were quickly endorsed by leading Western powers - most notably the United States and the United Kingdom - both of which had long maintained that the emergence of a nuclear-armed Iran was unacceptable.\nHowever, within just a few days, the tone and rhetoric began to shift significantly. Initial references to \"targeted strikes\" and \"regional security\" were gradually replaced by more explicit calls for political change in Tehran. Both Israeli and Western media outlets, as well as government officials, increasingly began to speak of \"regime change\" in Iran. This marked a notable shift in strategic thinking - from a policy of containment to one of direct intervention in Iran's internal political structure.\nThe escalation reached a critical point on June 22, when the US launched direct strikes on several key facilities within Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Although Washington continued to insist that the sole objective of these operations was the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear capabilities, the international response revealed deepening skepticism. Reports from international inspectors and independent analysts - including those from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and US intelligence agencies - indicated that there was no compelling evidence that Iran had actively pursued a nuclear weapons program in recent years.\nOn the contrary, despite the US government's unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, Tehran had continued to comply with many of the deal's core non-proliferation provisions. These included regular inspections, limits on uranium enrichment, and restrictions on centrifuge development. Independent assessments suggested that Iran's nuclear program remained largely civilian in nature, and that there was little basis for the claim that it posed an imminent threat.\nThe events of June and the intensifying military actions appeared to represent a turning point not only in Israeli and US policy toward Iran but also in the broader regional dynamic. Despite the official narrative, the strikes provoked concern among several international actors - including some NATO allies, as well as Russia and China - who warned that such operations risked sparking a wider conflict in the already volatile Middle East.\nWithin Iran, the attacks served to strengthen hardline elements in the government, fueling anti-Western sentiment and decreasing the likelihood of renewed diplomatic engagement. Rather than isolating the regime, the strikes seemed to reinforce its internal legitimacy in the face of perceived foreign aggression. As the situation evolved, what had initially been portrayed as a limited security operation increasingly appeared to be part of a broader geopolitical strategy aimed at reshaping Iran's political landscape by force.\nUnder the evolving circumstances, it became increasingly apparent that the narrative surrounding the nuclear threat had served primarily as a convenient smokescreen for a broader, more ambitious agenda. The calls for regime change in Iran had begun to resemble a coordinated political and information campaign rather than a spontaneous or principled reaction. Israel no longer attempted to conceal its objectives; its ultimate aim appeared to be the strategic dismantling of the Islamic Republic as a cohesive and sovereign force opposing West Jerusalem's interests throughout the Middle East.\nWestern allies - albeit with varying degrees of caution and internal dissent - gradually aligned themselves with this agenda. Consequently, the international discourse shifted away from preventing a hypothetical nuclear threat and toward enacting a calculated effort to reshape the regional order, effectively sidelining Iran as an independent and influential actor on the geopolitical stage.\nThis trajectory not only eroded what remained of regional stability but also laid dangerous foundations for a potential full-scale war, the consequences of which remained unpredictable. Attempts by Western leaders and media outlets to frame these developments as a \"struggle for democracy\" or a necessary measure to \"preserve global security\" rapidly lost credibility. The observable facts indicated that this was not a defense of universal principles, but rather a deliberate campaign to dismantle a political system that refused to conform to a unipolar, Western-centric model of governance and control.\nThis approach - rooted in coercive force, ideological vilification, and narrative manipulation - posed significant long-term risks for its architects. In the US, Europe, and even within segments of Israeli society, awareness began to grow that initiating a military conflict under the banners of liberalization and freedom might in fact plunge the entire region into widespread devastation. Moreover, it risked pushing Iran further toward radicalization, both in its foreign policy posture and in its domestic governance.\nAs the military confrontation escalated, the window for diplomatic solutions narrowed rapidly, and the costs - political, economic, and human - rose accordingly. At its core, it became clear to many observers that this was no longer an effort to contain Iran, but an outright attempt to eliminate it as a sovereign center of regional power. The issues at stake had moved far beyond nuclear non-proliferation or human rights; they revolved around a forceful redrawing of the political map of the Middle East.\nWhile there may have remained some space for measured analysis and strategic restraint in Washington, Israel appeared to be pursuing a policy consistent with a \"point of no return\" doctrine - committed to decisive outcomes irrespective of the broader consequences. One of the central questions that emerged in this context was how long the US could continue balancing between its loyalty to a close ally and its own long-term strategic interests and stability in the region.\nAmid the intensifying military operations and increasingly belligerent rhetoric from Israel and its Western partners, a large-scale media campaign unfolded - aimed at normalizing and legitimizing the idea of an imminent regime collapse in Iran. Both Israeli and English-language outlets published a growing number of reports and opinion pieces claiming that the Islamic Republic was on the verge of disintegration, that public support for the regime had collapsed, and that a coup or uprising was inevitable. These narratives were actively promoted by commentators, analysts, and government officials alike, contributing to an atmosphere in which regime change was framed not as a possibility, but as an impending and unavoidable reality.\nHowever, upon closer examination, this narrative construct appears to diverge significantly from reality. More independent and less ideologically driven observers - including regional analysts, international organizations, and academic experts - have reached the opposite conclusion: contrary to the hopes of those exerting pressure, a revolution is not brewing in Iran. Instead, the external pressure - accompanied by a harsh political-media campaign and military actions - is serving as a mobilizing force, fostering social cohesion and reinforcing the legitimacy of the current government.\nIranian history has shown time and again that external threats and military aggression do not weaken the state's stability - instead, they often catalyze national unity. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Iraqi invasion - backed by a coalition of global powers, including the US, USSR, France, and the Gulf monarchies - did not fracture Iran; rather, it united society behind the new leadership. The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) became a symbol of heroism, national solidarity, and the determination to defend sovereignty. Despite international isolation and staggering human and material losses, Iran endured - physically and morally - solidifying a doctrine of resilience in the face of foreign pressure.\nToday, a similar pattern is emerging. Despite serious domestic challenges - ranging from high inflation and unemployment to corruption and dissatisfaction with certain aspects of internal governance - the Iranian population understands well that the roots of many of these crises lie in the sanctions blockade and external pressure. This perception marks a fundamental distinction between Iran and other states, where protest potential can more easily evolve into political crisis. In Iran, there is a deeply rooted awareness that the country's sovereignty is under constant external threat. As a result, public criticism of the authorities rarely transforms into support for radical regime change - especially when the nation is under attack.\nMoreover, Iran's political culture is marked by a high degree of adaptability and historical consciousness. While corruption is undoubtedly a destructive force, it is not universally perceived as a systemic evil that threatens the state's very foundations. Rather, it is seen as part of a broader social context, one that includes elements of traditional patronage systems and the cultural phenomenon of bakhshish. This is not to justify corruption - but to emphasize that an anti-corruption agenda does not necessarily translate into revolutionary mobilization.\nAn equally important factor is the absence of a consolidated and influential opposition within the country. The fragmented groups within the Iranian diaspora - including monarchists, liberals, and nationalists - lack both a coherent platform and a charismatic leader capable of uniting Iranian society. The figure of Reza Pahlavi, heir to the deposed shah, evokes not nostalgia but suspicion among most Iranians, especially the youth. He is widely seen as a relic of an old, authoritarian, and deeply pro-Western regime with no meaningful connection to contemporary Iranian realities. Any attempt to revive the idea of monarchy within the country is doomed to fail - both due to the weight of historical memory and the profound absence of political trust.\nThe waves of protest that periodically erupt in Iran tend to be spontaneous, fragmented, and focused on specific economic or social grievances. They lack political leadership and do not pursue the explicit goal of overthrowing the existing system. In fact, such protests often serve as indicators of political dynamics within the regime itself - rather than signs of its disintegration.\nThis was underscored by the outcome of the recent presidential election, in which Masoud Pezeshkian, a representative of the moderate reformist camp, emerged victorious. His election confirmed that despite external pressure and internal challenges, Iranian society continues to engage with institutional politics - not by seeking violent regime change, but by advocating for the gradual transformation of the system. Pezeshkian, known for his openness to dialogue and pragmatic approach to foreign policy, has come to embody the aspiration for change from within - without dismantling the state. However, his early efforts to ease tensions on the international stage were met not with diplomacy, but with missile strikes. This sent a clear message: neither the United States nor Israel is truly interested in \"resetting\" Iran - they seek only an outcome in which the country is stripped of agency and reduced to a managed space within a regional order defined by external powers.\nWithin this context, the prospect of rapid regime change in Iran appears increasingly illusory. The Islamic Republic remains a resilient state structure, underpinned by stable institutions, a political tradition, and a deeply rooted sense of cultural legitimacy. At this stage, destabilization could occur only through a full-scale external intervention - via subversive operations, the incitement of separatist sentiments, armed proxy support, and systemic backing of opposition forces. But such a course would demand not only immense resources and long-term commitment - it would also carry the risk of dragging the region into a major conflict that could spiral into open war with unpredictable consequences.\nAgainst this backdrop, it appears that Israel's strategic goal is not to encourage reform or political transformation in Iran, but rather to dismantle the very foundations of Iranian statehood - as a force opposing Israeli and Western influence in the region. To achieve this, every available tool is being employed: from information warfare and diplomatic pressure to direct military action. The West - particularly Washington - has yet to formulate a coherent and consistent strategy. A serious ideological and political rift is emerging between official declarations about \"democratization\" and the de facto support for aggression against Iran. This cognitive dissonance is becoming increasingly apparent, both within Iranian society and on the international stage - further reinforcing the belief among many Iranians that the West's true objective is not to improve their lives, but to eliminate their country as an independent center of power.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear - both within Iran and beyond - that the aggression carried out by Israel and its Western allies against the Islamic Republic has nothing to do with democratization, human rights, or a genuine desire to improve the lives of ordinary Iranians. Behind the loud slogans of \"freedom\" and \"reform\" lies a far more pragmatic and ruthless objective: the elimination of Iran as a sovereign, independent, and inconvenient actor in the eyes of the Western-Israeli bloc. A country which, despite sanctions, pressure, and isolation, continues to maintain political agency and actively shape its own agenda in the Middle East - often in direct contradiction to the interests of Washington and West Jerusalem.\nThis is not about helping the Iranian people - it is about dismantling Iran as an independent center of power. Iran is not viewed as an object of salvation, but as an obstacle to the implementation of a comprehensive architecture of regional control. Thus, the aggression against it is not a defensive measure but a tool of geopolitical demolition.\nThis strategic motive is becoming increasingly undisguised. Israel openly signals that its goal is not de-escalation, but the neutralization of the Iranian threat by any means necessary - including the destruction of its nuclear and military infrastructure, the destabilization of its internal political system, and its diplomatic isolation. The US, while officially calling for restraint, has been effectively drawn into the conflict - not by choice, but under the weight of Israeli policy and domestic lobbying pressure. By initiating the military phase, Israel presented Washington with a fait accompli: either support your ally, or risk losing influence in the region. The Trump administration, despite its hardline rhetoric, exhibits internal division and strategic uncertainty - recognizing that large-scale intervention might not solve the problem but instead provoke a regional catastrophe.\nAs a result, a growing disconnect is emerging between declared intentions and actual behavior. On one hand, Iranian territory is being struck, civilians are dying, and infrastructure is being destroyed. On the other, efforts to preserve a narrow window for diplomatic dialogue continue. This political duality is not a sign of humanitarian concern - it is a reflection of fear: in the West, more voices are asking whether a war with Iran may prove to be the fatal miscalculation that not only fails to achieve its goals but also shatters regional stability - along with the reputational and strategic standing of those who initiated it.\nThe paradox is that both parts of the equation - the American political establishment and Iran's leadership - are increasingly aligned in one understanding: escalation does not lead to victory; it leads to mutual destruction. Unlike Israel, which is pursuing an all-out force-based solution aimed at eliminating Iran as a geopolitical rival, the US is attempting to walk a fine line - balancing its obligations to an ally with the imperative to avoid the catastrophic fallout of direct conflict. As long as even a trace of rational strategic analysis remains in Washington, the possibility of a diplomatic resolution still exists. But that window is closing rapidly - and with every new strike, it becomes less and less realistic.\nIt is becoming increasingly evident: behind the mask of \"combating authoritarianism\" and \"containing the nuclear threat\" lies a singular geopolitical calculation - to exclude Iran from the ranks of sovereign actors, to strip it of independent will, and to eliminate its ability to shape the regional agenda. This is not a struggle for reform - it is a struggle against the very existence of Iranian statehood. In this context, the primary restraining force today is not international law, nor the United Nations, nor formal agreements, but the cold strategic reasoning of those who still understand: in destroying Iran, one could just as easily destroy the fragile balance of Middle Eastern security - with consequences no political center will be able to fully control.\n(RT.com)\nGet a daily dose of Greek Herald news through our daily email, its complimentary and keeps you fully up to date with world and business news as well.\nPublish news of your business, community or sports group, personnel appointments, major event and more by submitting a news release to Greek Herald.\nMore InformationHONG KONG: China has fired back at the European Union in an escalating trade dispute by imposing new restrictions on medical device...\nPARIS, France: A strike by French air traffic controllers demanding improved working conditions caused significant disruptions during...\nDUBAI, U.A.E.: Saudi Aramco is exploring asset sales as part of a broader push to unlock capital, with gas-fired power plants among...\nPARIS, France: Fast-fashion giant Shein has been fined 40 million euros by France's antitrust authority over deceptive discount practices...\nGENEVA, Switzerland: A new United Nations report alleges that dozens of global corporations are profiting from and helping sustain...\nLONDON/STOCKHOLM: The Persson family is ramping up its investment in the H&M fashion empire, fueling renewed speculation about a potential...\nHONG KONG: China has fired back at the European Union in an escalating trade dispute by imposing new restrictions on medical device...\nWASHINGTON, D.C.: President Donald Trump is drawing praise from his core supporters after halting key arms shipments to Ukraine, a...\nLONDON, U.K.: An unrelenting heatwave sweeping across Europe has pushed early summer temperatures to historic highs, triggering deadly...\nThe recent military escalation against Tehran may have ended, but the efforts to remove it as an independent world power persist ...\nThe recent military escalation against Tehran may have ended, but the efforts to remove it as an independent world power persist ...\nNew Delhi [India] July 8 (ANI): Unified Payments Interface (UPI), India's flagship digital payments system, continues to reshape the...",

Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, and Maj. Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, a top official in the Guard, were also among those killed, along with with a string of other military and intelligence leaders, according to state media, including Gen. Mohammad Kazemi, the force's head of intelligence.\nIran's scientific community has also been hit by Israel’s strikes.

He introduced a similar legislation in 2020 during Trump's first term, also seeking to prevent U.S. from attacking Iran.\nIsrael does not want to harm civilians, defense minister says\nIsrael’s defense minister is now walking back his previous comment, saying it was “obvious” when he wrote that “the residents of Tehran would pay the price and soon” he didn’t mean Israel would “physically harm” them.\nHe meant they would be “forced to pay the price of the dictatorship.”\nKatz earlier accused Iran of targeting Israeli civilians in its overnight attacks, and then appeared to threaten civilians, saying “residents of Iran will pay the price.”\n‘Nothing was left’: Israeli residents react to Iranian missile strike\nAt least three people were killed after an Iranian missile hit a residential building in the central Israeli town of Petah Tikva, according to Israeli police. One resident said that after they heard the air raid sirens, they only had about two minutes to shelter before the missile struck.\nHow Trump went from opposing Israel’s strikes on Iran to reluctant support\nReporting from Washington\nPresident Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing.

            "US War on Iran Is Not About Nuclear Threats. It’s About US Power and Domination.. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nShortly after President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that the United States had conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an address in English, with a gleeful look on his face.\n“President Trump and I often say peace through strength,” Netanyahu said. “First comes strength, then comes peace. And tonight, President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength.”\nNetanyahu’s euphemistic jingoism obscures what is actually occurring: The “strength” here is an unprovoked war of aggression that the U.S. has joined Israel in waging, and the “peace” Netanyahu speaks of pursuing is sheer domination. Trump’s strikes add to the long history of the U.S. and Israel using brutal force to bend people, states, and international institutions to their will. Now, this war with Iran — in addition to Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza, its seizure of land in the West Bank, and its bombardment of Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen — is showing the full bankruptcy of a world order that allows Israel and the U.S. to subjugate others using death and deceit.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nBoth countries have spent decades spinning a lie about Iran’s civilian nuclear program, insisting, baselessly, that it is in fact a nuclear weapons program, something Iran gave up in 2003. With the assistance of corporate media pundits who have helped spread falsehoods around the Iranian nuclear program, they have manufactured a threat out of thin air. It is shameful for media to continue to fearmonger over the threat of a nuclear Iran when assessments from the U.S. intelligence community have clearly shown as recently as March that there is no evidence of Iran currently seeking or creating a nuclear weapon.\nPerhaps the fearmongering over nonexistent nuclear weapons in Iran is meant to deflect attention from the fact that the U.S. has more than 5,000 nuclear warheads — more than any other state besides Russia — and that Israel has an estimated 90 weapons of its own, a fact that it has never confirmed nor denied. Additionally, Israel, the only nuclear power in the Middle East, has never signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, making it one of the few nations to have failed to do so. Its own nuclear program has never been monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Now, outrageously, under the auspices of preserving global security and in the name of nonproliferation, these two nuclear states are bombing a nonnuclear state — a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that has willingly opened its doors to IAEA monitors.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the June 21 U.S. attack on Iran, panic about the potential spread of radiation erupted in the areas surrounding the three nuclear energy facilities bombarded at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. That panic layered with the anxiety of the ongoing Israeli strikes across the country. Human rights groups report that at least 865 Iranians have already been killed, as Israel attacks residential buildings, Iran’s state broadcaster, oil and gas depots, and Iran’s notorious Evin Prison, as well as medical facilities and workers.\nFor Iranians, the bombardment of the last 10 days, first from Israel and now from the U.S., have been a nightmare turned to life. Iranians within the country have struggled to make sense of panic-inducing warnings from Trump, who has demanded that residents of Tehran — a city with 17 million people living in its greater metropolitan area — “evacuate immediately.” Those of us in the diaspora have struggled to contact loved ones amid blackouts. And Iranian Americans like me have watched as our tax dollars go toward weapons that are used to attack the cities where our loved ones live. How did this happen?\nEver since 1979, the U.S. foreign policy establishment has held a direct war with Iran as a specter over all of our heads. War has been discussed as both inevitable and impossible, a potential quagmire that could make the fallout of the Iraq War look minimal. That hasn’t stopped the U.S. and Israel from finding every possible way to strangle Iran, from imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions, to conducting electronic warfare, to assassinating scientists and military leaders.\nThe U.S. notably assisted Iraq as it used chemical weapons against Iran during the eight-year Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and then shot down an Iranian commercial plane, killing 290 people, during that same war. Then the U.S. occupied Iraq and Afghanistan — neighboring countries on both sides Iran — while labeling Iran as part of an “axis of evil” and pressuring other nations to join in their crusade to isolate the country. All of this followed the 1953 coup in which the U.S. and United Kingdom ousted Iran’s oil-nationalizing prime minister, allowing Iran’s then-monarch to return to the country and repress its people for 26 more years, eventually with the help of a brutal secret police force trained by the CIA.\nIranians have long had the conditions of their lives limited by a power-hungry U.S. state. It is not surprising that this would eventually grow to include an active “hot war” — which this is, even though Trump and his ilk are reluctant to label it as one, both for legal reasons and, likely, to prevent further Iranian retaliation. But what else can you call an operation in which 14 “bunker-busting” bombs are dropped on another country?\nThis attack did not mark the U.S.’s entry into the war, either. Israel’s ongoing bombardment of Iran has been conducted by U.S.-made missiles, paid for with U.S. taxpayer funding, and shaped by U.S. logistical support. The U.S. reportedly sent hundreds of Hellfire missiles to Israel just before it began its shock campaign on Iran.\nThat weapons shipment came as Iran was in the midst of negotiations over its civilian nuclear program with the U.S., which, under Trump’s first administration, unilaterally dropped out of the agreement with which Iran was complying that put strict limitations on Iran’s uranium enrichment. Israel, seemingly with U.S. support, attacked one of Iran’s lead negotiators, effectively blowing up the negotiating table.\nYet somehow, Trump has had the audacity to demand, in all caps, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” from Iran in the aftermath of the U.S. strike. “NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE,” he posted on Truth Social shortly afterward. “IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR.” This is the future that these powers want — one in which “negotiations” are in fact acts of aggression meant to force other countries into submission. This war is not about nuclear weapons. It is about U.S. hunger for unbridled control, and that should terrify every other country.\nThe U.S. and Israel have long worked to engineer a reality in Iran and across the Middle East that would be favorable to their interests. Much of this has involved shaping and warping international norms and institutions for their own purposes. Year after year Netanyahu has stood up in front of the United Nations and on other international stages to say that this year — no, really, this year — would be the one in which Iran would become a nuclear threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. has weaponized its dominance in the international financial system to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically, threatening sanctions on countries and companies that dare to do business in Iran.\nNone of this is new. What is, though, a more recent development is the arrogance and glee with which the U.S. and Israel have discarded international norms and law wholesale, and how instead they now openly embrace and celebrate brute force to assert their power over others. They are shedding even the pretense and facade of the principles of a rules-based international order that has already worked in their favor.\nIn the past, when Israel assassinated Iranian nuclear scientists, it did so violently but covertly. During this war, those attacks transformed into a stunning spectacle of cruelty as Israel struck residential buildings that housed nuclear scientists, along with all the other Iranian civilians who lived in those buildings.\nBut why would we expect any less after last year’s pager attack in Lebanon, in which Israel turned personal devices into explosives, killing dozens and wounding thousands, including children? As if it were not enough to commit such a crime, Israeli leadership later flaunted that attack, handing out mounted pagers to U.S. political allies like Trump and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.\nDespite insisting that its targets in Iran are military and nuclear sites, Israel seems to be deploying once again its terrifying “Dahiya doctrine,” a principle of collective punishment it first employed in Lebanon in 2006. The doctrine calls for attacks on civilian targets in an attempt to force adversaries to surrender while also undermining any popular support they may have. The very concept is a violation of the fundamental concepts of international law, and it has been used more dramatically than ever since 2023.\nNowhere is that dedication to collective punishment more evident than in Israel’s ongoing, U.S.-backed, livestreamed genocide in Gaza, during which Israeli soldiers have themselves openly flaunted war crimes on social media. People all over the world have access to clear video evidence of crimes against humanity, and yet largely have not acted to stop them. Despite the fact that Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court, several states party to the Rome Statute have threatened not to comply with their legal obligations to arrest him, openly flouting international law in service of genocide.\nNow, Israel is also developing malicious new ways to kill the Palestinians in Gaza living under its brutal siege, shunning basic humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence to instead prop up a privatized aid scheme that’s widely considered to be a “death trap.” Now, tanks routinely fire on starving Palestinians as they wait in line at aid distribution points run by the Israeli and U.S.-backed scheme, desperate for food. Likely part of Netanyahu’s calculus for attacking Iran now included the assessment that doing so would divert some international attention from these ongoing crimes in Gaza.\nIsraeli impunity is matched only by that of the U.S., where the post-9/11 congressional Authorization for the Use of Military Force has normalized U.S. drone and airstrikes abroad. Under that authorization, the U.S. continues to conduct a range of what it calls “counterterrorism” operations in dozens of countries.\nThe lack of accountability for the U.S. invasion of Iraq has echoed throughout this entire operation in Iran. The parallels between the U.S.’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and its attacks on Iran this month are beyond obvious. The same people have been brought out to peddle the myth of weapons of mass destruction, from David Frum, the Bush speechwriter-turned-Atlantic senior editor who first slotted Iran into the “axis of evil”; to Reuel Marc Gerecht, the CIA analyst-turned-pundit who swore in the pages of The New York Times in 2002 that an Iraq War wouldn’t destabilize the Middle East.\nIran has its own Ahmed Chalabi, the controversial Iraqi politician who urged on the U.S. invasion of his home country — someone who could best be described in Farsi as a vatan foroosh (“homeland seller”). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed former Shah of Iran, has been gleefully advocating for Israeli military action while he waits from the comfort of his home in the U.S., insisting he is ready to install a “constitutional monarchy” in Iran, whatever that might mean. Now, as in the post-9/11 period, we also see U.S. officials insisting that Iran is planning to launch “sleeper cell” attacks within the U.S. — a claim that will surely be used to clamp down on dissent against the war as well as manufacture even more consent for ongoing U.S. attacks on Iran.\nLike in 2003, battle lines are being drawn; rather than point to the absurdity of U.S. and Israeli claims, European leaders are now issuing statements that lead off with the pronouncement that Iran can never have nuclear weapons, while urging Iran — which did not instigate the current conflict — to exercise restraint.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz went so far as to applaud Israel for doing the “dirty work … for all of us” of attacking Iran last week, adding: “I can only say, [I have] the greatest respect for the fact that the Israeli army had the courage to do this, that the Israeli state leadership had the courage to do this.”\nThis is the world we are entering — one in which acts of state aggression are not only tolerated, but also celebrated. The answer here isn’t to go back to the pre-2023 order, in which the U.S. and Israel merely adopted more discreet forms of violence, but to take an honest look at the multiple ways in which both countries have evaded accountability for inflicting horror and shape our movements to prevent that horror from happening in the first place.\nThis means creating a real antiwar movement in the U.S. — one that will go beyond challenging the legality of the Trump administration’s war on Iran to actually challenging that war itself. It means demanding arms embargoes. It means escalating the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement to exact real economic costs for committing genocide. It means organizing across sectors to keep weapons from making it into the hands of génocidaires. It means urgently building organizations that can respond to immediate crises while also building infrastructure for long-term political struggles that do not fade with the news cycle or depend on electoral outcomes.\nGovernments have shown they are either unwilling or unable to hold the U.S. and Israel to account. Those of us incensed by Israeli and U.S. acts of aggression must take on that mantle ourselves.\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

Israel’s ongoing “widespread strikes” in Tehran and elsewhere have left Iran’s surviving leadership with the difficult decision of whether to plunge deeper into conflict with Israel’s more powerful forces or seek a diplomatic route. WATCH: Middle East experts discuss what’s next for the region as Israel-Iran conflict erupts Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said on social media the sixth round of indirect nuclear talks on Sunday “will not now take place,” adding that “diplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.” Although the talks are off for now, “we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,” said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomacy. Israel and Iran signaled more attacks are coming, despite urgent calls from world leaders to deescalate and avoid all-out war. The attack on nuclear sites set a “dangerous precedent,” China’s foreign minister said. The region is already on edge as Israel makes a new push to eliminate the Iranian-backed militant group Hamas in Gaza after 20 months of fighting. Israel — widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East — said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days killed a number of top generals, nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s U.N. ambassador has said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded. Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook buildings. Israel said three people were killed and over 170 wounded. “If (Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front — Tehran will burn,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran’s nuclear program his top priority, said Israel’s strikes so far are “nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.” In what could be another escalation if confirmed, semiofficial Iranian news agencies reported an Israeli drone struck and caused a “strong explosion” at an Iranian natural-gas processing plant. It would be the first Israeli attack on Iran’s oil and natural gas industry. Israel’s military did not immediately comment. The extent of damage at the South Pars natural gas field was not immediately clear. Such sites have air defense systems around them, which Israel has been targeting. Iran calls nuclear talks ‘unjustifiable’ Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran was not actively pursuing the bomb. But its uranium enrichment has reached near weapons-grade levels, and on Thursday, the U.N.’s atomic watchdog censured Iran for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran’s top diplomat said Saturday the nuclear talks were “unjustifiable” after Israel’s strikes. Abbas Araghchi’s comments came during a call with Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s top diplomat. The Israeli airstrikes were the “result of the direct support by Washington,” Araghchi said in a statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency. The U.S. has said it isn’t part of the strikes. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to reach a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, adding that “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.” U.S. helps to shoot down Iranian missiles Iran launched waves of missiles at Israel late Friday and early Saturday. Iranians awoke to state television airing repeated clips of the strikes, as well as videos of people cheering and handing out sweets. The Iranian attacks killed at least three people and wounded 174, two of them seriously, Israel said. The military said seven soldiers were lightly wounded when a missile hit central Israel, without specifying where — the first report of Israeli military casualties since the initial Israeli strikes. WATCH: Israel hit with missiles as Iran retaliates for strikes on nuclear sites and leaders U.S. ground-based air defense systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the measures. In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an Associated Press journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one whose front was nearly entirely torn away. Residents of a central Israeli city hit Friday night, Rishon Lezion, said the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open. “We thought, that’s it, the house is gone, and in fact half of the house was gone,” said Moshe Shani. Israel’s main international airport said it will remain closed until further notice. Indications of a new Israeli attack Israel’s army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, said Israel had attacked more than 400 targets across Iran, including 40 in Tehran, where dozens of fighter jets were “operating freely.” He said it was the deepest point Israel’s air force had operated. Defrin said fighter jets struck over 40 “missile-related targets and advanced air defense array systems” across Iran. WATCH: ‘This is a threat to our existence,’ Israeli ambassador says of Iran’s nuclear program A governor of Eastern Azerbaijan province in northwestern Iran said 30 troops and a rescuer had been killed there, with 55 others wounded. Gov. Bahram Sarmast’s remarks were the latest acknowledgment of mass casualties. Iranian state television reported online that air defenses were firing in the cities of Khorramabad, Kermanshah and Tabriz. Footage from Tabriz showed black smoke rising. The sound of explosions and Iranian air defense systems firing at targets echoed across central Tehran. Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported a fire at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport. ‘More than a few weeks’ to repair nuclear facilities Israel attacked Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. Satellite photos analyzed by AP show extensive damage there. The images shot Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility. U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said. Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, including “infrastructure for enriched uranium conversion,” and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four “critical buildings” at the Isfahan site were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. “As in Natanz, no increase in off-site radiation expected,” it added. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army’s initial assessment “it will take much more than a few weeks” for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had “concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.” Israel denied it had struck the nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Tehran, after an Iranian news outlet close to the government reported the sound of explosions nearby. Netanyahu said the attack had been months in the making and was planned for April before being postponed. Among those killed were three of Iran’s top military leaders: one who oversaw the entire armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri; one who led the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami; and the head of the Guard’s aerospace division, which oversees its arsenal of ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh.

It was the second public appearance by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei since the strikes began, and came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” in a social media post and warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows where he is but has no plans to kill him, “at least not for now.” WATCH: Trump faces difficult choices in support for Israel’s war on Iran Trump initially distanced himself from Israel’s surprise attack on Friday that triggered the conflict, but in recent days has hinted at greater American involvement, saying he wants something “much bigger” than a ceasefire.

U.S. intelligence agencies have said they did not believe Iran was actively pursuing the bomb. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons but has never publicly acknowledged them. WATCH: How Israel’s strikes have damaged Iran’s nuclear capabilities Iran’s ambassador to Geneva, Ali Bahreini, told reporters that Iran “will continue to produce the enriched uranium as far as we need for peaceful purposes.” He rejected any talk of a setback to Iran’s nuclear research and development from the Israeli strikes, saying, “Our scientists will continue their work.” Israel welcomes first repatriation flights Israelis began returning on flights for the first time since the country’s international airport shut down at the start of the conflict. Two flights from Larnaca, Cyprus, landed at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport on Wednesday morning, said Lisa Dvir, an airport spokesperson. Israel closed its airspace to commercial flights because of the ballistic missile attacks, leaving tens of thousands of Israelis stranded abroad. The conflict has disrupted flight patterns across the region. Frankel reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writers Amir Vahdat and Nasser Karimi in Iran, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva, contributed.

            "Political Analyst: Israel Wants Iran to Stay Isolated and in Conflict With US. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!\nU.S. President Donald Trump is touting a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, despite what he said were violations of the deal by both sides shortly after he announced it. Trump said he was especially angry with Israel and urged the country to stand down as he faces mounting criticism over the prospect of another U.S. war in the Middle East. “Part of the reason why Trump also was quite eager to get to a ceasefire, why he’s so frustrated with what the Israelis are doing right now, is precisely because he’s very much aware of the strain that all of this has caused within his own support base,” says political analyst Trita Parsi. Parsi says the breakdown of the global Non-Proliferation Treaty on nuclear weapons could lead to dangerous consequences, as countries like Iran see incentive to build their own nuclear deterrence.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.\nStay in the loop\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nI’m Amy Goodman in New York joined by Democracy Now!’s Juan González in Chicago. Hi, Juan.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Hi, Amy. And welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world.\nAMY GOODMAN: Israel’s Defense Minister has ordered intense strikes on Tehran just hours after President Trump announced a fragile ceasefire. Iran denied the accusations that it violated the U.S.-and-Qatar-brokered truce. President Trump spoke to reporters on the White House lawn before leaving for the NATO Summit in the Hague this morning. He expressed extreme frustration with both countries but especially Israel.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out, and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I’ve never seen before, the biggest load that we’ve seen. I’m not happy with Israel. When I say, “Okay, now you have 12 hours,” you don’t go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So, I’m not happy with them. I’m not happy with Iran either. But I’m really unhappy if Israel’s going out this morning because of one rocket that didn’t land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn’t land. I’m not happy about that. We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the [bleep] they’re doing. Do you understand that?\nAMY GOODMAN: F-bombs and real bombs. President Trump also posted on social media, quote, “Israel, do not drop those bombs. If you do, it is a major violation. Bring your pilots home now,” unquote. President Trump first announced the ceasefire on social media Monday in the wake of an Iranian missile attack on the largest U.S. base in the Middle East, in Qatar. Qatar condemned the strike as a, quote, “Flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty.”\nIran gave advanced notice before the strike, and there were no injuries reported. This retaliatory strike followed the U.S. dropping bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday and 12 days of fighting between Israel and Iran after Israel launched an initial unprovoked attack. For more, we’re joined by Trita Parsi in Washington D.C. He’s the Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, author of several books, including Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Welcome back to Democracy Now!. Trita, so much has happened in the last two weeks, but let’s talk about the last hours. If you can talk about Israel’s attack on Iran, Iran’s retaliation, then U.S. dropping these bombs, the significance of this and then supposedly a fragile ceasefire in effect.\nTRITA PARSI: I think Trump is discovering the very core of the problem, and I think we can see his frustration here. And the core of the problem, at the end of the day, is that Israel does not want peace. Israel wants to continue this war. Israel wants only unilateral ceasefires in which it is allowed to continue to bomb the countries in question. That’s exactly what it has done in Gaza, that’s what it has done in Lebanon, and they wanted the same thing here. And they wanted to make sure that the United States could not keep itself out of the war that Israel unnecessarily started. I think there’s a part of Trump that he genuinely wants to get to a deal. I think the manner and the pathways to that that he’s choosing are the wrong ones. But I think he was genuine about getting the ceasefire, staying out of this. We have seen the revolt that has taken place in large parts of his own base. And now, he’s discovering that the Israelis, at the end of the day, wanted to drag him to this point in order to keep him in the war, not allow him to get out of the war or not allowing a peace or a ceasefire to break out.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Trita, I wanted to ask you, we’ve had the reports in the U.S. media that Iran warned the United States before launching its counterstrike on the U.S. base, but only – there’s been a report by Amwaj.media, which is an operation out of Qatar that covers Iran, and Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula. And they claim that the United States warned Iran before the attacks on the nuclear facilities, and as a result, Iran was able to remove most of its enriched uranium, and that there were no casualties on the Iranian side in those attacks. Have you heard anything differently, or do you put much credence in this report?\nTRITA PARSI: I do strongly believe this report. Amwaj has proven itself to be one of the absolute top news sites in order that understand what is going on in Iran, and their sources have been completely impeccable. But I also think that this is actually in – this is in line with past patterns as well, in which both sides, every once in a while, when they want to do something, but they don’t want it to be too escalatory, they don’t want the situation to get out of control, have given each other direct or indirect warnings. In this case, clearly, the Iranians telegraphed very clearly what they wanted to do. The Qataris knew about it long beforehand.\nBut it was also a way for the Iranians to do something that went beyond what they did after Qasem Soleimani was killed by Trump in 2020, in which they struck U.S. bases in Iraq. This time, they struck it in a GCC country, making it quite different from what it was in 2020, but at the same time, it was nevertheless done in such a way that there would be no casualties, providing the U.S. with no reason to escalate further, rather give both themselves and the United States an exit ramp out of this, which Trump clearly took very quickly, moving towards a ceasefire that he had to impose on the Israelis. And we’re seeing now how unhappy the Israelis are about that.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you said that the current escalation is not about nuclear proliferation. What do you think is the motivation, especially for Israel?\nTRITA PARSI: Well, from the Israeli standpoint, for more than three decades now, this has not been about a nuclear issue, it’s been about domination in the region, the geopolitical rivalry that they have with Iran, significant fear that they have that if the United States and Iran were to negotiate, if they were to strike a deal, reduce their tensions, Iran would end up not necessarily becoming a friend of the United States, but tensions between the U.S. and Iran would reduce significantly without it necessarily reducing Israeli-Iranian tensions, which then would leave the Israelis in a position of abandonment, as they call it. And they would face Iran without having this type of automatic support of the United States.\nThis is long in the making. If the Israeli concern truly was nonproliferation, then they would have supported Obama’s Iran deal, the JCPOA, because it did close off all patterns for Iran to build a nuclear weapon. But Israel’s preference was and remains an Iran that may have a nuclear weapon, but that is isolated, is at conflict with the United States, whose economy being crushed than an Iran that does not have nuclear weapons but has improved ties with the U.S., is trading with the rest of the world, is rehabilitated into the international community, and as a result, can challenge Israel’s position in the region and its aim for military hegemony, even though it does not have nuclear weapons.\nAMY GOODMAN: Trita, I wanted to get your comment on Vice President J. D. Vance. He appeared on Fox News yesterday to tout the long-term effectiveness of U.S. airstrikes on Iran.\nVICE PRESIDENT J. D. VANCE: Our hope is that the lesson that the Iranians have learned here is, “Look, we can fly a bunker-buster bomb from Missouri to Iran, completely undetected without landing once on the ground, and we can destroy whatever nuclear capacity you build up.” I think that lesson is what’s going to teach them not to build the nuclear capacity.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, that was the Vice President. And if you could elaborate further on why you’re arguing that this U.S. attack on Iran has destabilized the world to, as you say, nuclear countries, nuclear bomb countries, both the United States and Israel, attacking a non-nuclear country, Iran, what it says to other non-nuclear countries around the world, who gets attacked, and who doesn’t?\nTRITA PARSI: I think the Vice President’s point is not one that needed to be made. I don’t think the Iranians under any circumstance were under the illusion that the United States did not have the capability of bombing that facility. Whether the U.S. has the capability of truly destroying it or not remains to be seen because we still have not the final report of what type of damage was done here. I fear that the conclusion the Iranians will draw, which goes to your second point–and not just Iran, many other countries as well–is that you had here two nuclear-equipped countries attacking a non-nuclear state in the midst of negotiations, despite the fact that none of the nuclear-equipped countries have been attacked by the non-nuclear state.\nIsrael was not attacked by Iran, Israel initiated this conflict. The United States certainly was not attacked by Iran, it initiated this round of attacks. There is no basis for claiming this to be self-defense, even anticipatory self-defense. What this then says to a lot of other countries, not just in the region but throughout the world, is that you are completely unsafe vis-a-vis nuclear powers. And if you want to have some sort of an ability to deter nuclear powers from attacking you, you may have to become a nuclear power yourself. So, I think this was a major blow to the nonproliferation treaty, similar to the manner in which many people in Washington argue that Russia’s invasion, illegal invasion, of Ukraine was a blow to the nonproliferation treaty, since Ukraine actually hosted nuclear weapons before the breakup of the Soviet Union.\nSo, if that is the case in the Russian-Ukrainian case, it certainly is the case also in the Israeli-U.S.-Iranian case. So, I think that even though in the short run, some limitations may have been put, the Iranian program may have been delayed, I fear that this is going to dramatically motivate the Iranians to build a nuclear deterrence, and it will do so as well for other countries in the region, particularly Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and then, of course, beyond the region as well.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Trita, what do you make of the reported divisions within the MAGA base over what is happening in Iran? Clearly, President Trump’s scoffing at Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and also Tucker Carlson and other key voices of the MAGA movement criticizing what’s going on?\nTRITA PARSI: The whole movement toward some form of either confrontation with Iran, as we now have seen by the United States, but also the endorsement and the support that was provided by the United States to Israel’s war of aggression on Iran are things that I think has put a tremendous amount of strain within the MAGA movement and within the Republican Party. The only element of the Republican Party that really generally has supported this is the more hawkish neoconservative base, which only has a base in Washington. There’s no constituency for that outside of Washington. The rest of the United States much more falls into the “America-first” base of Trump support.\nAnd within that, you can see some very clear strains because many of these individuals have truly adopted the view that the United States should stay out of these unnecessary wars, that the United States oftentimes is being dragged into these conflicts by some of its allies. And for some time, many of the folks on the right could manage to hold that view but make an exception for Israel. But over the last year or so, I think it’s become clear that that cognitive dissonance no longer was sustainable. Because if you make an exception for Israel, mindful of the fact that it is the country most likely to drag the U.S. into another war in the Middle East, at least, then you have kind of negated the principle as a whole. And I think we have seen that cognitive dissonance break down with individuals like Tucker Carlson and others going out long before this, really criticizing the role of Israel in terms of pushing the U.S. into wars.\nAnd now this has happened, we see clearly how betrayed much of that base feels. Now, I think many of them, of course, want to get back into Trump’s good graces, but not without making sure that the U.S. doesn’t get dragged into this war. And I think part of the reason why Trump was quite eager to get to a ceasefire, why he’s so frustrated with what the Israelis are doing right now, is because he’s very much aware of the strain that all of this has caused within his own support base.\nAMY GOODMAN: And Trita Parsi, want to thank you for being with us.

            "It’s Time to Put an End to the US-Israeli Fantasy of Regime Change in Iran. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nAs an Iranian, I felt a surge of relief — and cautious hope — when I heard news of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The bloodshed had gone on for 12 long days. The killing, the airstrikes, the relentless tit-for-tat violence — it all had to stop. If for nothing else, for the sake of the people on both sides. Now, of course, Israel’s massacre in Gaza must end, too.\nBut even in that moment of relief, my mind was flooded with uneasy questions:\nWould this ceasefire hold? Could it? With no clear picture of the damage inflicted on Iran’s nuclear facilities after the U.S. attacks, are we facing more skirmishes — or something far worse?\n-\nWill Iran and the U.S. negotiate in good faith about the future of Iran’s nuclear program?\n-\nAnd then, the hardest question of all, the one that keeps circling back no matter how many times we push it aside: What happens now to the political fervor within Israel and the U.S. to bring about regime change in Iran?\n-\nAs for the first question, I could only hope the ceasefire holds and that Iran and Israel avoid further military escalation. Skirmishes may still flare — history tells us as much. But a full-scale war? I doubt it. The sheer destruction and loss of life on both sides have already taken a staggering toll. Iran’s health ministry says that 610 people were killed in the war; rights organizations put the estimate closer to 950. Meanwhile, 28 Israelis were killed. Experts also say that Iran’s missile stockpiles are running low, just as Israel’s supply of interceptors is being depleted.\nGet our free emails\nAs for the prospect of another U.S. strike on Iranian soil — especially after Donald Trump’s controversial bombing of Fordow, Iran’s heavily fortified nuclear facility buried deep within a mountain — it seems unlikely. The political backlash he faced from parts of his own base was immediate and fierce. Even Donald Trump, no stranger to reckless moves, may think twice before doing it again.\nThe second question is more difficult to answer: Can Iran and the U.S. ever negotiate in good faith over Iran’s nuclear development program? To be fair, Iran, for its part, has tried three times — and each time, it was deceived by Donald Trump.\nThe first betrayal came when Trump, during his first term, unilaterally tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a multilateral agreement that had capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 percent and placed its nuclear program under the full surveillance of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Iran had complied with every condition. So why did Trump abandon it? Because it was Obama’s deal, and in his eyes, that alone made it unacceptable.\nThe second betrayal came not long into Trump’s second term, when his administration offered Tehran a proposal similar to Obama’s, assuming Iran would fold. According to credible reports, the two sides had reached a broad agreement and were preparing to meet on June 15. But on June 13, Israel launched an unprovoked surprise attack on Iranian soil — an act many believe was carried out with Trump’s tacit approval, if not direct coordination — sabotaging the talks.\nThen came the third betrayal. On June 19, Trump issued a two-week ultimatum, demanding that Iran “come to its senses” and agree to a new deal. Just two days later, without congressional approval or international support, he launched another illegal strike — targeting Natanz, Isfahan, and Iran’s deeply fortified nuclear facility in Fordow.\nAnd then, came the spectacle.\nTrump stepped to the podium in a made-for-TV moment — part Obama announcing Osama bin Laden’s death, part George W. Bush beneath a “Mission Accomplished” banner. The theatrics were familiar. So was the premature triumphalism. With the swagger of a mob boss and the flair of reality TV, he declared that now that Iran’s nuclear capabilities had been “completely and totally obliterated,” it was time for Tehran to “make peace.”\nBut the illusion of success unraveled quickly. According to The New York Times, citing classified U.S. intelligence, the strikes may have set back Iran’s nuclear program by only a few months. The attack on Fordow sealed off entrances to two tunnels but failed to collapse the underground structures where enrichment occurs. The core of the program remains intact.\nTrump may be perfectly content with that outcome. After all, no one — except Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump himself, and their band of loyalists — ever truly believed Iran’s nuclear program was a non-peaceful development. That fiction has long been used as a political tool, not a strategic truth. And now, with a ceasefire in place and a headline-ready performance behind him, Trump may once again be ready to talk (or pretend to).\nBut wait! What are his counterparts in Iran thinking now?\nFool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me. Fool me three times? No one should trust you — ever!\nThere’s a powerful faction within the Iranian regime that has long argued negotiations with the United States are futile — that every overture will be met with betrayal. After three failed attempts, their case may have just gotten stronger. Would they prevail? Would Iran now pursue a weapons program as a deterrent? That’s quite possible.\nLet’s hope they don’t try, and let’s also hope that against the odds, Trump keeps his word this time.\nNow, to the most difficult question: What happens to the joint Israeli-U.S. dreams of regime change?\nA regime change through foreign intervention is near impossible in Iran. In fact, Trump and Netanyahu have accomplished what the Islamic Republic itself failed to do in 45 years — unite the Iranian people. Even some of the regime’s most outspoken critics, including Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi and jailed reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh, called for an end to the war. They, along with many activists in the diaspora, are now rallying in defense of Iran.\nI say Iran, not the flag or the regime, because nearly everyone outside the hardliner faction supports either sweeping reform or a full change in government. But they also agree that they do not want a regime change imposed by foreign powers. Not by bombs. Not by invasions. Not by exiles with microphones and no mandate.\nThe only prominent political faction still clinging to the fantasy of regime change by force is the group of opportunists orbiting Reza Pahlavi — the exiled son of Iran’s deposed shah. A relic of a bygone era, Pahlavi commands a shrinking, disconnected base. He left Iran as a teenager, and stories of his youthful indulgences are the stuff of tabloid lore. His long-standing pursuit of the throne has been marked by missteps, contradictions, and political insensitivity. In 2023, he traveled to Israel to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an attempt to curry favor from the state that has long threatened to conduct military strikes against Iran. And in the past 12 days, while millions of Iranians prayed for peace amid escalating violence, Pahlavi applauded Israeli actions over and over again. But if there’s one thing Iranians don’t forget, it’s betrayal. And for many, celebrating bombs dropped on your homeland is exactly that. As one guest said on CNN this week, Pahlavi “looks more like Ahmad Chalabi than George Washington,” referring to the Iraqi politician who urged regime change in the early 2000s from the comfort of his own home in the United States.\nSo, let’s get serious: What would a regime change look like? Not the Hollywood version. Not the “liberation” dreams sold to exiles on satellite TV. The real version would be the one soaked in blood, chaos, and long-term devastation. The Iraq-and-Afghanistan version.\nBesides, military-driven regime changes usually start with a foreign power wrapping its ambitions in the flag of “liberation.” Remember Afghanistan in 2001? Iraq in 2003? The U.S. didn’t just drop bombs and go home. It spent months building coalitions, gathering intelligence, and deploying hundreds of thousands of troops. And what followed wasn’t peace. It was a quagmire. Trillions of dollars later, both countries were left broken. ISIS (also known as Daesh) famously grew out of the instability the U.S. left in Iraq. In Afghanistan, the Taliban seized power back again.\nAnd Iran is no Iraq. It’s nearly four times larger in size and double the population, with a stronger national identity and a more complex social fabric. Any attempt at invasion or occupation would demand a military mobilization, unlike anything the U.S. has undertaken in modern history. And even then, it would fail.\nThen comes the next phase: collapse from within. Take Libya. NATO bombed Muammar Gaddafi out of power in 2011. Western leaders cheered. The result wasn’t democracy but chaos. The country disintegrated into militia-run fiefdoms, enslavement, and civil war.\nApply this to Iran, and the picture gets even darker. Without a central government, separatist movements in Kurdistan, Khuzestan, Sistan and Baluchestan, and even Azerbaijan could be armed and emboldened by foreign interests. The result? Balkanization. Ethnic warfare. Prolonged instability.\nAnd please, let’s dispense with the fairytale that Pahlavi — or any exiled figure — could return to “liberate” Iran. Resistance from regime loyalists, militias, or simply civilians defending their neighborhoods would make any such attempt suicidal. Just as loyalists to Saddam Hussein regrouped into insurgents and Gaddafi supporters fought on, the forced collapse of the Islamic Republic would spark a civil war, not a coronation.\nSo, regime change through foreign intervention is neither possible nor desirable. But an organic, homegrown transformation by the people of Iran, for the people of Iran, remains within the realm of possibility. Iran has been suffocating under debilitating sanctions for more than four decades. This war will only deepen the suffering. Will Iranians, already traumatized by violence and repression, have the will or energy to rise in the immediate aftermath of another conflict? Perhaps not. But the ground could shift down the road. Public discontent may harden into renewed resistance.\nThe danger, however, is that in the absence of a peaceful, civilian-led transition, a military coup could fill the vacuum, pushing Iran even further away from the possibility of democracy. That would be the ultimate tragedy: trading one authoritarian regime for another, and silencing the hopes of a nation that has fought so long and lost so much in pursuit of freedom.\nKeep the press free.

            "Kennedy's new CDC panel includes members who have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation. Kennedy's new CDC panel includes members who have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F\nNEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.\nThey include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.\nKennedy's decision to “retire” the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess — and possibly end — longstanding vaccination recommendations.\nOn Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: “We’re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel – not anti-vaxxers – bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.”\nThe new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.\nAnother is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he’s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.\nHe has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He’s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.\nOther appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.\nAbram Wagner of the University of Michigan’s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he’s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.\n“The previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,” he said. Most people on the current list “don’t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.”\nHe said having Pebsworth on the board is “incredibly problematic” since she is involved in an organization that “distributes a lot of misinformation.”\nKennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.\nThe committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC’s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.\nThe other appointees are:\n—Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.\n—Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.\n—Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.\n—Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.\nOf the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel.\nDuring his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.\nUltimately, the FDA disregarded the panel’s recommendation and OK’d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.\nIn addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one “consumer representative” who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.\nKennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government’s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.\nMost of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.\n“If you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you’re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,” Schwartz said.\nThe U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.\nKennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.\nIn late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.\nOn Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.\nA HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Matthew Perrone, Amanda Seitz, Devi Shastri and Laura Ungar contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

            "‘Undermining trust’: Kennedy’s promises on vaccines put to the test. ‘Undermining trust’: Kennedy’s promises on vaccines put to the test\nThe health secretary wants regulators to question long-settled science and public health guidance.\nIn convincing wary senators to confirm him as the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised he would not discourage people from getting vaccines or make the shots “difficult” to access.\nNow that the longtime anti-vaccine activist has the job, he’s putting his promise to the test.\nIn the four months since GOP senators signed off on Kennedy’s appointment as secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has moved deliberately to upend the people and processes that have guided decision-making about vaccines.\nThis week, he purged a government panel of outside vaccine experts and appointed eight replacements, some of whom share his view that the government has covered up vaccine side effects. He skipped the advisory process in changing who the government says should get Covid vaccines and stoked confusion when he issued updated guidance that gave parents room to decide for themselves. He’s hired an anti-vaccine activist to scour government records on vaccine safety and launched a search for autism’s cause. Kennedy has long believed vaccines are one cause of the neurological disorder.\n“If we have a system that has been dismantled — one that allowed for open, evidence-based decision-making and that supported transparent and clear dialogue about vaccines — and then we replace it with a process that’s driven largely by one person’s beliefs, that creates a system that cannot be trusted,” said Dr. Helen Chu, a University of Washington School of Medicine professor who was dismissed from the vaccine panel this week.\nIn the absence of independent, unbiased advice, she added, “we can’t trust that safe and effective vaccines will be available for use in the United States.”\nKennedy’s sweeping moves in his first few months on the job underscore the broad mandate President Donald Trump gave him to remake the federal health department.\n“Secretary Kennedy is restoring trust by demanding radical transparency and ending the complacency that defined past public health failures,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told POLITICO in a statement Thursday, noting that Kennedy’s commitment to putting “accountability and radical transparency first” will “restore trust in our public health system.”\nKennedy has said his mission is to reestablish trust by rooting out corruption in the health agencies — stemming, he believes, from the symbiotic relationship between regulators and industry.\nBut leaders in the public health establishment say his actions are more likely to do the opposite, arguing he distorts scientific data to suit his message.\n“What he’s doing is undermining trust,” said Tom Frieden, who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during Barack Obama’s presidency.\nFrieden worries that Kennedy’s hyper-skepticism about vaccine safety, which could be amplified now by like-minded members of his vaccine advisory panel, will mislead more people into believing the shots are unsafe, causing immunization rates to dip and infectious diseases to spread.\nKennedy’s belief that vaccines often carry serious side effects already has led to policy change, with HHS dropping guidance that pregnant women get vaccinated for Covid. HHS cited evidence that the shot was linked to miscarriages — though one of the researchers footnoted in an HHS document disputed the agency’s characterization. Thirty-two medical groups protested the decision earlier this week.\nAmong the new members of the vaccine advisory panel are Dr. Robert Malone and Retsef Levi, who share Kennedy’s view that Covid vaccine side effects are more serious than the government has disclosed.\nThe changes Kennedy has made, public health experts warn, are upending the nation’s health agencies and risk paralyzing decision-making about what advice to give the public.\nBut to Kennedy’s supporters, he’s just doing what Trump asked him to do.\n“Frankly, the experts really got an awful lot wrong about Covid in particular, so I think in general the American population right now is pretty darn skeptical of the so-called experts,” said Mary Holland, president and general counsel at Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded.\nAn unprecedented move\nThe vaccine panel Kennedy has upended, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is one of four external panels housed at HHS that advise agencies on vaccine policy, but it’s regarded as the most influential.\nThe panel helps set the CDC’s childhood and adult immunization schedules, and several state and federal laws reference ACIP recommendations — including the Affordable Care Act, which requires health plans to cover vaccines the committee recommends for routine use without cost-sharing. ACIP also votes on whether vaccines should be offered through the Vaccines for Children program that ensures low-income and under- and uninsured kids can access shots for free.\n“If the secretary puts in place an advisory committee that shares his views around vaccination … I can envision the committee not making recommendations for vaccine use in children, or revisiting the existing schedule and changing some of those recommendations,” Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director who’s now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told POLITICO Tuesday. “We would be in a situation where your ability to get a vaccine depends on how much money is in your pocket.”\nThe demise of an independent ACIP, Chu said, would lead to “a patchwork of different policies by different states” — a development that could see some states stop mandating certain vaccines for school entry and likely increasing the risk of infectious disease.\nHistorically, the CDC director decides whether to accept, reject or amend the group’s recommendations, but it’s unclear whether anyone is filling that role.\nDr. Susan Monarez, a former Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health official, was tapped to lead the CDC, compelling her to step down as acting director. Kennedy told lawmakers in May that agency chief of staff Matthew Buzzelli — a lawyer with no public health background — was in charge.\nEven Holland called the absence of a confirmed CDC director “troubling” and questioned whether the Senate is prioritizing the position.\nIf approved, Monarez would be the first confirmed CDC director since Congress changed the law in 2023 to require the Senate to vote on the position. The Office of Government Ethics posted her financial disclosure forms on Saturday, which clears the way for the Senate health panel to schedule a confirmation hearing.\nACIP voting members usually serve four-year terms — and STAT has reported that the Biden administration intentionally stacked the committee’s membership, selecting replacements for members whose terms were set to expire in June.\nEven so, Kennedy’s decision to fire all of the panel’s members and replace them is unprecedented. The HHS secretary wields broad authority to manage the panel as he sees fit under federal law.\nAnd the slate he announced late Wednesday includes several people known for questioning the safety of either messenger RNA vaccines specifically or, more broadly, the childhood schedule.\nDr. Jeffrey Klausner, a former public health official in California, has informally advised Kennedy since the November election, including compiling a list of names for new ACIP members who he thought would balance public health imperatives with vaccine safety concerns. None of his suggestions made the cut so far, he told POLITICO.\n“Most people don’t understand there are very different ethics in the practice of public health. In medicine, it’s all about ‘do no harm,’ and it’s about advocating as much as one can for the benefit of that individual patient,” Klausner said. “In public health, you’re trying to do the most good for the most people.”\nKennedy said the new members will “review safety and efficacy data for the current schedule,” raising questions about how the new panel may seek to change recommendations relied upon by pediatricians nationwide.\n“I’m very disappointed. Not so much for me, but for public health,” said Mysheika W. Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus, Ohio, who was slated to join ACIP in July, replacing one of the members whose terms was set to expire. “How are we going to make sure we have individuals at the table who can make decisions that impact everyone in our country, and really make those decisions based on proper data and proper science?”\nChoice vs. obligation\nThe firing of the vaccine advisers is only Kennedy’s most recent effort to remake HHS’ administrative structure in his image.\nIt follows his decision to launch a search for autism’s cause — he’s putting $50 million into it and promising answers within months — and his cancellation of a nearly $600 million contract with Covid shotmaker Moderna to use its mRNA platform to develop a bird flu vaccine. Kennedy has called the mRNA Covid shots from Moderna and Pfizer the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”\nAt the same time, Kennedy and the vaccine-wary wing of his Make America Healthy Again movement have elevated the once-fringe view that vaccination should be an individual choice and not a public obligation.\nKennedy has made the point repeatedly in congressional testimony and in his response to an ongoing measles outbreak. He has said he believes reassuring Americans that vaccination is up to them, and not required, is essential to restoring trust in public health after vaccine mandates drew backlash during the pandemic.\nBut Kennedy’s perception of “evidence-based decision-making with objectivity and common sense” — the approach he said the vaccine advisory panel’s new roster would take — runs contrary to that of most scientists. They see vaccination as one of the most important public health interventions to limit and prevent disease spread, along with clean water, and believe it essential that people feel an obligation, if not a requirement, to get vaccinated.\n“It’s the rise of individualism going against collective good, and public health DNA is public good — it’s protecting the population to protect the most vulnerable,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who’s consulted for the CDC. “That’s just a very different framework in theory than the medical freedom movement, and how you reconcile those two things in this moment is the big question.”\nWhile Klausner said he’s disappointed with Kennedy’s ACIP choices, he’ll continue to offer the secretary advice because he’s in the position of authority.\n“I’m trying to work with him to keep things on the rails,” he said.",
            "Health secretary RFK Jr. abruptly fires CDC vaccine advisory panel. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken the extraordinary step of firing the expert panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on immunizations, saying the action is needed to restore faith in vaccines.\n“A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy said in an op-ed published Monday afternoon in the Wall Street Journal.\nProponents of vaccines have feared Kennedy, who is openly skeptical of vaccines and has long been critical of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, might take such a step. ACIP studies vaccines in the regulatory pipeline and ones that have recently been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, advising the CDC on who they should be offered to once they have been approved.\nAppointing replacement members to the advisory panel would give Kennedy broad latitude to reshape the government’s childhood immunization schedule and other vaccines advice. New members haven’t yet been named, but it would appear they may have been selected, because a statement from Kennedy’s department said that a meeting scheduled for late June will take place. In normal times, ACIP candidates go through a vetting process that can take upward of a year.\n“We have just demonstrated that politics will overrun science in this administration. It scares me to think of what’s ahead,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\nOne of the fired members of the committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, was floored by the move. The committee members were not informed in advance, the individual said. Later in the day, they received an unsigned email informing them of their immediate termination. “We appreciate your prior service and commitment,” it concluded.\nThe committee member predicted upheaval in vaccination policy going forward.\n“Providers are no longer going to follow the CDC [vaccination] schedule,” the individual predicted. “The CDC has lost credibility in the vaccination space. … It adds a lot of uncertainty for care for children and adults.”\nBill Cassidy (R-La.), the Republican chair of the Senate’s health committee, expressed grave concerns about Kennedy’s anti-vaccine positions during his confirmation hearing, before ultimately voting to confirm him. He said on the social media site X that he’d spoken with Kennedy on Monday and is working to ensure the panel won’t be filled with people “who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.”\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called the decision to purge ACIP “excessive.”\n“I think these vaccines and other advisory committees are very helpful to the public in providing guidance,” she said. “So to cancel all of the people … that raises serious questions.”\nThe ACIP meets three times a year — more often during emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic — to review data on vaccines and recommend how they should be used. Their recommendations must be approved by the CDC director — the position is currently unfilled — or the HHS secretary to go into practice. Kennedy has not signed on to three recommendations the ACIP made at its last meeting in April.\nRichard Hughes, a lawyer with the firm Epstein Becker Green, warned that vaccination policy that is science-based appears to be on the verge of becoming a thing of the past.\n“This upends 61 years of thoughtful, evidence-based decision-making,” Hughes, who once worked at the vaccine manufacturer Moderna, told STAT in an email. “At a minimum, it means the involvement of new members will introduce misinformation into what has been a science-based forum.”\nBruce Gellin, a former director of the HHS National Vaccine Program Office, shared that concern.\n“What we learned in Epidemiology 101 about confirmation bias was better said by John Steinbeck in ‘The Winter of Our Discontent’ — ‘You know how advice is — you only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyway,’” Gellin said. “All eyes will be on the advice the new advisory committee members provide.”\nPaul Offit, a former member of the committee and one of the developers of a vaccine that protects against rotavirus infection, said the committee’s work over decades has markedly improved the health of children and adults in this country. “They should be given an award, not fired,” said Offit, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n“RFK Jr. has for 20 years shown you who he is. And nothing has happened since he’s been secretary of HHS to make you feel any differently,” Offit added.\nMany public health officials expressed deep concern about what ACIP will become and what the decision will mean for the credibility of vaccine recommendations that emerge from the CDC. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, was among them. “We’ll look back at this as a grave mistake that sacrificed decades of scientific rigor, undermined public trust, and opened the door for fringe theories rather than facts to guide the recommendations that doctors rely on to protect patients,” he said in a statement.\nThe step followed reporting from STAT on Sunday that revealed that four members of the 17-person panel had received termination notices because their special government employee contracts had lapsed.\nIn addition to firing all 17 sitting members of the panel, Kennedy terminated the appointments of several experts who had been approved to join the ACIP in July to replace members whose terms were expiring. Before leaving office, former health secretary Xavier Becerra and his team filled all open and upcoming vacancies on the ACIP to try to protect the group’s scientific integrity.\nKennedy’s move appears to fly in the face of commitments he made to Cassidy when being confirmed to lead HHS. At the time, Kennedy promised to maintain ACIP recommendations without creating a new safety system, Cassidy said then.\n“If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes,” Cassidy said in a floor speech.\nAsked by a reporter on Monday about this commitment, Cassidy responded that Kennedy promised not to touch “the process” of vaccine approval.\nWriting in the Journal, Kennedy argued that he was acting to restore confidence in America’s public health leadership, saying the Biden administration stacked the committee, and portraying the group as a rubber stamp for approvals riddled with conflicts of interest.\nThe Biden administration approved eight new candidates to the committee just before leaving office, with some former officials saying the move was intended to keep the Trump administration from removing mainstream scientific expertise. The HHS statement about Kennedy’s decision cited that aim as a reason for firing all sitting members.\nAnd though some outside experts say ACIP could have stronger conflict of interest policies, they have said Kennedy’s assessment is incomplete at best. In announcing the ACIP firings, Kennedy said the committee members aren’t necessarily corrupt. “The problem is their immersion in a system of industry-aligned incentives and paradigms that enforce a narrow pro-industry orthodoxy,” he wrote.\nKennedy’s critics have pointed to the conflicts he brings to the discussion about vaccines. He’s spent years leading a nonprofit that argued — without evidence — that vaccines are linked to autism, signed book deals to question the safety and efficacy of shots, and received fees for referring plaintiffs who say they were injured by vaccines. (Kennedy pledged to withdraw from his previous business dealings when taking the helm of HHS, though he refused to promise to not sue vaccine manufacturers after his tenure.)\nHis history could make boosting trust in the CDC difficult. Even Kennedy’s allies have acknowledged that trust can only be restored if the vast majority of Americans — including those who disagree with him — believe the systems are not being changed for political reasons. The move to remake ACIP will weaken trust in the system, public health leaders said.\nThe president of the American Medical Association, Bruce Scott, said the action “undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives. With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses.”\nThe MAHA PAC run by Kennedy allies, which is pouring money into state races and issues, posted on X, “The MAHA Revolution is finally here. … The truth about vaccines is about to be EXPOSED.”\nChildren’s Health Defense, the vaccine-criticizing nonprofit Kennedy founded, and the anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny were similarly upbeat about the news. “This is unprecedented. And long overdue. The foundation is shaking. Keep your eyes open,” Tenpenny posted on X, alongside a link to a news article.\n“Hope the good news continues,” CHD responded. The group has for years alleged that conflicts of interest, such as grant funding from companies that make vaccines, skewed ACIP recommendations toward approving certain shots. Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician who had her license revoked, then reinstated, during the pandemic, has been named in at least one of Kennedy’s books as a hero for “medical freedom.” She, like others, pushed back on vaccination mandates and alleged Covid vaccines make people magnetic. (They do not.)\nCritics of Kennedy’s aggressive anti-vaccines stands have been readying themselves for something of this nature. Osterholm’s center, CIDRAP, recently launched what it has called the Vaccine Integrity Project, led by high-level figures including former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Margaret Hamburg, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine).\n“We take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,” the two wrote in an opinion piece published in STAT in April. “Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.”\nIsabella Cueto and John Wilkerson contributed reporting.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated 19 members of the ACIP had been fired. There were only 17 sitting members, all of whom were fired."

            "Louisiana political campaigns might get to withhold more donation, spending info. 6:31\nNews Story\nLouisiana political campaigns might get to withhold more donation, spending info\nMatthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator\nLouisiana lawmakers might diminish information available to the public about political donations and election spending through a sprawling rewrite of the state’s campaign finance law.\nGov. Jeff Landry is pushing House Bill 693, sponsored by House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington. It carves out more circumstances under which political contributions and expenditures don’t have to be disclosed on a public campaign finance report.\nThe 101-page proposal is difficult to understand for people who don’t deal with campaign finance regulations frequently. Even staff attorneys for the Louisiana Board of Ethics, which enforces the campaign finance laws, admit the changes are confusing.\n“To be honest with you, it’s going to take quite a grace period to figure all this out,” Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said when presenting the bill to the state ethics board last month.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nPrivate attorneys Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies helped write the bill. They have represented Landry in multiple disputes he has had with the ethics board, including over campaign finance laws and enforcement.\nGelé has said the proposal respects constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, while still providing transparency and “preventing the appearance of corruption.”\nThe state’s preeminent government watchdog group disagrees. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR) has come out against the legislation, saying the bill would benefit politicians while offering little for the general public.\n“There is a very large bill, and I don’t quite understand the problem it is trying to solve,” PAR President Steven Procopio said at a legislative hearing last month.\nThe Louisiana House voted to approve the legislation on a 77-16 vote last month. The Senate will start taking up the bill Wednesday, and both chambers need to pass it by the end of the legislative session on June 12.\nIn more than 20 places in the law, the bill increases the minimum dollar threshold at which a donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report.\nFor example, national political committees that raise most of their money outside Louisiana are required to publicly disclose their spending on a Louisiana election once it reaches $20,000. The proposed bill would hike that disclosure threshold to $50,000.\nThe current law also requires any campaign contributions or expenditures over $200 given within the 20 days before the election to be reported on a public campaign finance report. The proposed law would hike that disclosure threshold to $5,000.\nLouisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans\nOver a dozen similar changes are also part of the legislation.\nIndividuals who are not political candidates and groups that are not explicitly political committees could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking.\nThose who are not a candidate or a designated political committee would only be required to disclose election spending over $1,000 in a political cycle and if it involved:\n- federally-regulated broadcast media;\n- 500 pieces of mail;\n- a phone bank of 500 calls within a 30-day period; or\n- digital or print advertising with a candidate’s image that’s distributed in the area the candidate would represent within 30 days of their primary and 60 days of their general election\nThese changes would apply to large, statewide elections and smaller ones such as those for police juries, town councils and school boards.\nMoney spent to communicate with people in a “membership organization” – such as a union, industry association or an athletic club – as well as employees and stockholders of a business also would not have to be reported as a political expense. This could include communication sent to thousands of people at once.\nIn some cases, current campaign finance law obliges people to report this type of spending that would be shielded under the Wright bill. But supporters of the legislation said these exceptions were mainly carved out with so-called social welfare organizations, which already aren’t required to disclose their donors, in mind.\nThe organizations, which critics call “dark money” political groups, are registered with the IRS as 501(c)(4) nonprofits for tax purposes and can keep their contributors private under federal regulations. It’s unclear to what extent the groups have to disclose their spending on Louisiana elections under current state campaign finance laws.\nLandry has set up at least one of these “dark money” groups, Protect Louisiana Values, to advance his political agenda. It also notably put up the money for Landry to rent a live tiger to attend an LSU football game last year.\nDefying Landry, Louisiana lawmakers reject giving him more control over licensing boards\nFormer Gov. John Bel Edwards also established two of his own “dark money” groups during his eight years in office: Rebuild Louisiana and A Stronger Louisiana.\nWhile limiting disclosure on political spending, Wright’s legislation does open up allowable uses of politician’s campaign funds to a much wider group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships.\nThe legislation is also one of a few bills Landry is pushing to soften ethics laws and regulations this session. Lawmakers in favor of them said they are reacting to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board.\nIn 2007, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and legislators passed dozens of restrictions and public disclosure requirements for elected officials and public employees as part of Jindal’s effort to reach a “gold standard” of ethics for Louisiana that would be a model around the country.\nLawmakers are now saying that effort was overreach that needs to be corrected.\n“I haven’t come across an elected official who has enjoyed working through this process and hasn’t questioned what they did back in the Jindal era,” Wright said of ethics and campaign finance regulations.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "Louisiana legislative session 2025: Winners and losers. Gov. Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)\nLouisiana lawmakers adjourned the 2025 regular lawmaking session Thursday having passed a budget with hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending; bills aimed at lowering insurance races; and a massive rewrite of state ethics laws.\nIn its early days, the eight-week session was at first dominated by a battle between insurance companies and the personal injury attorneys over how to lower car insurance rates.\nThat policy dispute also led to a showdown between Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, over who should be held responsible for Louisiana’s sky-high insurance costs.\nAt the end of the session, the governor engaged in a power struggle with Senate President Cameron Henry over private school vouchers and prescription drug regulations.\nThe following list evaluates how certain political figures and causes fared in the lawmaking session:\nWINNER: Senate President Cameron Henry\nHenry, a Metairie Republican, resisted pressure from Landry and the conservative House to push through more radical policy proposals than he said the Senate, which has a more moderate approach to politics, felt uncomfortable adopting.\nDespite a wave of attack ads in the media and pressure from the governor, Henry refused to fund an expansion of Louisiana’s private education voucher program. He also declined to force a Senate vote on a proposal to radically remake Louisiana’s pharmacy network, in spite of social media threats from Landry to force a vote on the issue.\nThe Senate president blocked a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies that the House endorsed. His chamber also turned down a proposal from Landry to give the governor more control over licensing boards and commissions.\nTOSS-UP: Gov. Jeff Landry\nAs noted above, Landry lost a couple of high-profile legislative fights with the Senate over his signature private education voucher initiative and prescription drug regulations.\nSome of his strong-arm tactics also simply weren’t effective at getting his agenda passed, particularly in the Senate.\nLandry’s public rally with school children that was meant to pressure legislators into funding more vouchers didn’t elicit the response he wanted. The ultimatum he issued to call lawmakers back into a special session also didn’t force the Senate into passing the pharmacy bill he was backing.\nOn other fronts however, he had legislative victories. He was largely able to get his agenda to address Louisiana’s car insurance crisis through the Legislature. A number of bills that reworked the way state agencies – including the Louisiana Workforce Commission, Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Children and Family Services – function also passed.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nLOSER: Government transparency\nLawmakers approve a handful of bills that will make it difficult to scrutinize government officials for inappropriate behavior, government corruption and conflicts of interest.\nHouse Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, could subject people to jail time and fines if they post personal information about state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and Public Service Commissioners on the internet.\nIt prevents the elected officials’ home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, license plate numbers from being published in government records or on a public website. Also protected under the law are marital records and birthdates.\nAn official’s church, the school or daycare their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded.\nTwo other pieces of legislation that massively write government ethics and campaign finance laws would also lead to less disclosure of who is donating to and spending money on political campaigns.\nWINNER: Government corruption\nAlong with weakening public transparency laws, Landry and lawmakers have made it harder for the Louisiana Board of Ethics to charge any elected official, public employee or government contractor with wrongdoing.\nThe change to the board’s investigative process may simply allow those accused of wrongdoing to run out the clock on the board’s ability to even bring charges against them, according to the board’s own members.\nThe board is only given a year to investigate and charge a person with a violation before it reaches a legal deadline to do so. The new process for investigations is more time consuming and will make it difficult to finish on time, board members said.\nLOSER: Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple\nTemple successfully pushed most of his legislative agenda through, but he lost a public feud to fellow Republican Landry over a bill that would allow the governor to cast blame onto him for the state’s insurance crisis. He will now have greater authority to reject insurance rate hikes, a responsibility he doesn’t want to have. He will now be open to criticism when he doesn’t turn down rate increases that are not popular with the public.\nWINNER: Insurance industry\nInsurance companies are the real winners of Temple’s agenda of “tort reform” bills they have been trying to get on the books for years. The new laws are supposed to tamp down lawsuits and reduce the amount of money plaintiffs can recover from bodily injury accidents.\nLOSERS: Carbon capture critics\nCarbon capture and sequestration made a cozy home for itself in Louisiana this session. Bills attempting to assert local control over where and whether projects to store injected carbon dioxide underground happen largely died in committees.\nOther moves to ban the practice entirely or tax CO2 injection also got little love. Surviving CCS measures that made it into law are provisions restricting the use of eminent domain for CO2 storage transport pipelines and keeping court venues for these eminent domain claims local to the parish in question.\nWINNER: Rep. Dustin Miller\nMiller, an Opelousas Democrat, holds a key seat as chairman of the House Committee on Health and Welfare in a legislature where Republicans hold the supermajority. One of his bills was amended in the late stages of the session to prohibit companies from owning both drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers in Louisiana. Although the legislation was denied a final vote in the Senate on the last day of the session, Miller still received a bipartisan standing ovation from his colleagues in the House for his effort.\nHe did manage to finesse an exclusion for his home city in one of the year’s most contested bills. A statewide ban on speeding enforcement cameras everywhere but school zones will take effect Aug. 1, except in Opelousas.\nWINNERS: Public school teachers\nLandry and lawmakers had initially said they would not give public school teachers another $2,000 pay stipend after a constitutional amendment to provide that money permanently failed to pass in March. They quickly backtracked, however, and ended up putting the teacher’s stipend back into the budget for the 2025-2026 school year.\nThe lawmakers are also putting another constitutional amendment on the ballot next year that would raise teacher pay slightly if the voters approve it. Teachers and school support staff would get $2,250 and $1,125 more respectively in their permanent pay if the ballot proposition passes.\nThe teachers also successfully fought off legislation that would have made it harder for their unions to collect dues that are automatically deducted from paychecks.\nLOSERS: Abortion medication providers\nDoctors and activists who provide abortion-inducing medications to Louisianians could be sued under a proposal approved by lawmakers.\nHouse Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, easily passed both chambers. She dubbed her proposal the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” though it would apply to all forms of the procedure.\nIn addition to allowing out-of-state providers to be sued, it extends the window for filing litigation from three years to five.\nTOSS-UP: College athletes\nLouisiana college athletes will not be receiving a tax exemption on their name, image and likeness (NIL) income this year, as two proposals to do so stalled due to the state’s lean budget situation. But lawmakers may take another crack at it after a task force meets over the next year and submits recommendations for NIL legislation.\nBut each Division I college athletics program in Louisiana will be the beneficiary of an increased gambling tax, which will send nearly $2 million annually to be spent on expenses benefitting athletes.\nWINNERS: Nursing home owners\nNursing home owners were able to pass legislation that will limit the damages collected from wrongful death and injury lawsuits brought against their facilities. There are 60-plus pending lawsuits from former clients and their families against nursing home ownership groups across the state currently.\nLOSERS: Civil service workers\nLawmakers approved a constitutional amendment that could weaken the state civil service system that provides protections to thousands of state employees. The proposal still needs approval from Louisiana voters before it’s enacted, but the fact that the bill made it out of the legislature this year signals that a two-thirds majority of lawmakers may no longer value a system that has held strong in Louisiana for roughly 70 years.\nWINNERS: DEI and academic freedom\nA proposal that would have prohibited diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curricula for undergraduate students was purposefully stalled in the Senate.\nHenry, the senate president, said the measure was unnecessary.\nThe bill was also opposed by The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors.\nLOSERS: People incarcerated on split-jury verdicts\nLouisiana voters amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate convictions through non-unanimous juries in felony criminal trials, but the change didn’t apply to such verdicts before the change. Two years later, U.S. Supreme Court ruled that split-jury verdicts were unconstitutional, but it left it up to Louisiana to determine whether their ruling would apply to older cases.\nLawmakers have tried multiple times since then to provide an avenue for those convicted by non-unanimous juries to seek a review of their cases. Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, managed to get his bill through committee this year, but it was shot down on the Senate floor despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, an ardent anti-crime proponent.\nWINNER: Children’s teeth\nLouisiana lawmakers opted against a conspiracy-theory fueled bill that would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water. Water fluoridation is considered key in reducing dental complications in children.\nLOSER: Wetlands\nIt is now easier to build in Louisiana’s isolated wetland areas— kind of. The state adopted a new definition of what counts as a wetland with Senate Bill 94 by Senator Mike “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, excluding areas cut off from surface water connection to rivers and lakes or surrounded by levees.\nDespite some legal confusion as to whether the legislation violates the Clean Water Act, there are now legal avenues to argue that these isolated wetland areas don’t need permits to drain, dredge and fill.\nWINNER: Fortified roof program\nLawmakers have embraced the state’s fortified roof program as one of the only effective means of lowering homeowner insurance rates. This session, they established a new $10,000 income tax credit that should go a significant way in helping homeowners afford the hurricane-resistant roofs.\nWINNER: Saudi Arabia\nLouisiana has included $7 million in the state budget to spend on a LIV Golf League event that is expected to come to the Bayou Oaks golf course in New Orleans City Park next summer.\nSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets, owns LIV Golf.\nLOSER: Science\nThe governor has signed a bill that bans the dispersion of chemicals for weather modification. Technological advances in have safely produced results in rain-starved areas, but they have also launched far more unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Louisiana joins Florida and Tennessee with new laws based on this speculation, and similar legislation is under consideration in other states.\nAwaiting the governor’s signature is a bill that would allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. The drug’s proponents praise it as a treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, though federal regulators haven’t approved it for that use.\nJulie O’Donoghue, Piper Hutchinson, Wes Muller, Elise Plunk and Greg LaRose contributed to this analysis\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "In final days of session, legislature advances Landry immigration agenda. 12:00\nNews Story\nIn final days of session, legislature advances Landry immigration agenda\nOfficers with Louisiana State Police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement escort a man arrested March 13, 2025, at the Port of Lake Charles. ICE reported 11 arrests of people working at the port who did not have legal status to be in the United States (Photo courtesy of ICE).\nTwo controversial state bills in the Louisiana Legislature — both designed to aid federal and state crackdowns on immigration — are in the final stages of becoming law after passing overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives Monday.\nWith days to go in the spring legislative session, Louisiana’s House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of Senate Bill 100, which requires agencies to track undocumented immigrants who receive state services, and Senate Bill 15, which makes it a crime for law enforcement agents, and others, to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies. The session is set to adjourn on Thursday.\nThe bills both advance the priorities of Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative immigration hardliner and ally of President Donald Trump.\nSenate Bill 100, sponsored by Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, which requires service providing public agencies – including the state Department of Education, Department of Corrections and the Department of Children & Family Services – to collect data and report to the State on the immigration status of people who receive those services. It passed 74-27 Monday afternoon.\nSenate Bill 15, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, criminalizes the failure of local officials – including sheriffs and other law enforcement officers – to cooperate with federal immigration agencies, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. It also criminalizes acts by everyday Louisiana residents deemed to obstruct or “thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. It passed 71-30.\nIf Senate Bill 15 becomes law, it would directly conflict with immigration policies adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office and, potentially, the New Orleans Police Department, both of which are under federal orders to limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal immigration agencies.\nBoth have already passed the Senate. SB100 will now head back to the Senate for Senate President Cameron Henry’s signature and then to Landry’s desk for his signature.\nSenate Bill 15, however, was amended in the House before final passage. The Senate will have to vote to approve the amended version before it can move on to become law.\nAdvocates against the pieces of legislation say the bills, once effected, will push Louisiana’s immigrant community into the shadows.\n“With the passage of SB 100 and SB 15, our state has sent a chilling message: that Immigrant families and anyone seeking safety or services are seen as expendable.” said Tia Fields, who manages policy for advocacy group Louisianan Organization for Refugees and Immigrants in Baton Rouge. “Let’s be clear: these bills aren’t about public safety. They’re about punishment.”\nSenate Bill 15\nIf enacted, Senate Bill 15 will be the first state law in the U.S. that criminalizes interference with immigration enforcement efforts, considered to be civil matters, or refusals to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.\nDuring debate on the House Floor on Monday Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, repeatedly asked how the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office would follow the law, which directly contradicts an agency policy that was created under federal court order.\nThe bill requires jailers, including sheriffs, to honor administrative requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to hold an immigrant beyond their release date from jail so that they can be brought into ICE custody.\nBut a Sheriff’s Office policy prohibits the agency from honoring hold requests except in cases where a jail detainee is accused of a particularly serious crime. The policy exists as the result of a 2013 federal court settlement stemming from a 2011 civil rights case in which two men said they were illegally held in the city’s jail for months at the request of ICE. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, another immigration hardliner, is challenging that settlement agreement.\nLouisiana already has a law, Act 314 of 2024 – enacted through Senate Bill 208, sponsored by Miguez and passed last year – that blocks local law enforcement agencies from adopting so-called ”sanctuary” like the one at the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. But unlike Senate Bill 15 — which calls for prison sentences of up to 10 years — that is a civil law, carrying no jail time for failure to comply.\n“The Orleans Parish Sheriff, who should be trying to get out from under the handcuffs of the consent decree, [is] using that as a shield to avoid the possible implications of refusing to cooperate with ICE,” Morris told committee members.\nWill Harrell, senior program monitor for the Sheriff’s Office said while he’s disappointed that the bill passed, he is “not surprised with the outcome, given the anti-immigrant climate.” He said he’s concerned about how Orleans Parish Sheriff, Susan Hutson, will follow both the state law and the federal court order\n“The sheriff does not intend to be a breaker of laws,” Harrell said. “It’s just a question of which law we need to follow.”\nSenate Bill 100\nSenate Bill 100 mirrors a 2024 executive order from Landry, signed in the early days of his governorship, that requires state departments and their sub-agencies to calculate and report on the amount of money that undocumented immigrants are costing the state. According to Rep. Michael Johnson, R-Pineville — who brought the bill to the House floor — Landry and Murrill requested SB15 be crafted to codify the language in that executive order.\nUndocumented immigrants are already shut out of some state-administered services. They are ineligible for food stamp benefits or Medicaid, for example, and they can’t get drivers’ licenses. But they attend schools, get medical treatment at public hospitals and use emergency shelters, among other things.\nAdvocates against the bill said recording identifying information like citizenship or immigration status, will not only affect undocumented immigrants, but also people who may not trust their government for other reasons, making it less likely that they seek out essential services like medical care.\n“Not all of these services require any kind of identification right now, [like] the low barrier homeless shelters or food banks or things like that, and there are people who are going to be unwilling to get benefits if it requires of citizenship verification,” Sissy Phleger, a safety net analyst for state think tank Invest in Louisiana, said in a phone interview last week. “It is going to burden people in Louisiana who don’t have enough to eat. I don’t have a place to live and that seems cruel and unnecessary.”\nDuring discussions over the bill on the House floor, Democratic Caucus chairperson Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, expressed concern over the proposed penalties in the bill: the withholding of funding to agencies that do not comply.\n“For me it seems kind of like a threat,” Willard said.\nJohnson called the penalty an “incentive” to follow the law.\n“This is just transparency,” Johnson said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis article first appeared on Verite News New Orleans and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday. WATCH: Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar reflects on legacy of slain state lawmaker The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offenses. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder. “Boelter planned his attack carefully” by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives. Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial. Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said. “This was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,” said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. “One man’s unthinkable actions have altered the state of Minnesota,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after Boelter’s arrest. The search for Boelter was the “largest manhunt in the state’s history,” Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman’s home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled. A photo posted by the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office appears to show Vance Luther Boelter, 57, the suspected gunman in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, in custody, at an unidentified location, released June 15, 2025. Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office via Facebook/Handout via Reuters Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him. During the search, police said they received information confirming someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He surrendered to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said. Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail at 1:02 a.m. Central Time Monday and include two mug shots, one from the front and one from the side, of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt. A targeted attack Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would’ve continued had Brooklyn Park officers not checked on Hortman’s home, causing Boelter to flee. The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter’s arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 just after 2 a.m. to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans’ home. Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home, the complaint says. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter’s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials. A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.

Walz to Minnesota lawmakers’ shootings Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other. Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn’t say what he had done. “I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” he wrote in messages viewed by AP. An escalation in political violence The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned. “This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said Sunday. On Sunday evening, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar shared a statement from Yvette Hoffman expressing appreciation for the outpouring of public support.

I took 8 and we are both incredibly lucky to be alive. We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark.” Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, “You were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.” Pam Stein came with flowers and knelt by the memorial. An emotional Stein called Hortman an “absolute powerhouse” and “the real unsung hero of Minnesota government.” Karnowski reported from Minneapolis, and Balsamo and Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

On Sunday evening, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar shared a statement from Yvette Hoffman expressing appreciation for the outpouring of public support.

(AP) — Hundreds of law officers fanned out across a Minneapolis suburb Saturday in pursuit of a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her home in what Gov. Tim Walz called “a politically motivated assassination.” Authorities said the suspect also shot and wounded a second lawmaker and was believed to be trying to flee the area. Democratic former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin address, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. WATCH: Minnesota Gov. Walz holds briefing on shootings of two state lawmakers and their spouses Authorities identified the suspect as 57-year-old Vance Boelter, and the FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Authorities displayed a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings. Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said investigators obtained video as well. He did not give details on a possible motive. Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other. The early morning attacks prompted warnings to other elected officials around the state and the cancellation of planned “No Kings” demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway. Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets. A Minnesota official told The Associated Press that the suspect’s writings also contained information targeting prominent lawmakers who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. The shootings happened at a time when political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. “We must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence,” Walz, a Democrat, said at a news conference. “Those responsible for this will be held accountable.” The governor also ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Hortman’s honor. Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect’s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. An overnight shooting Police responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans’ home shortly after 2 a.m., Champlin police said, and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds. After seeing who the victims were, police sent officers to proactively check on Hortman’s home. There they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer at the door, leaving the house. “When officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home” and escaped on foot, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. Multiple bullet holes could be seen in the front door of Hoffman’s home. John and Yvette Hoffman each underwent surgery, according to Walz. “We are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt,” the governor said at a morning news conference. Trump said in a statement that the FBI would join in the investigation. “Our Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the FBI, are investigating the situation, and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” Two Democratic lawmakers targeted Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year’s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita. Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to help champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota’s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions — and to protect providers who serve them. WATCH: State Rep. Finke responds to assassination of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman Walz called her a “formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.” “She woke up every day, determined to make this state a better place,” he said. “She is irreplaceable.” Hortman and her husband had two adult children. The initial autopsy reports from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office gave their cause of death as “multiple gunshot wounds.” The reports said Melissa Hortman died at the scene while her husband was pronounced dead at the hospital. Hoffman, 60, was first elected in 2012 and was chair of the Senate Human Services Committee, which oversees one of the biggest parts of the state budget. He and his wife have one daughter. State Patrol Col. Christina Bogojevic asked people “out of an abundance of caution” not to attend “No Kings” protests. Bogojevic said authorities did not have any direct evidence that the protests would be targeted, but noted the “No Kings” flyers in the car. Organizers announced that all demonstrations in the state were canceled, but many people still showed up for protests at the Capitol and elsewhere in the Twin Cities area. The suspect Boelter was appointed to the workforce development board in 2016 and then reappointed in 2019 to a four-year term that expired in 2023, state records show. Corporate records show Boelter’s wife filed to create a company called Praetorian Guard Security Services LLC with the same Green Isle mailing address listed for the couple. On a website for the business, Boelter’s wife is listed as president and CEO, while he is listed as director of security patrols. The homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and “Praetorian” painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest. An online resume says Boelter is a security contractor who has worked in the Middle East and Africa, in addition to past managerial roles at companies in Minnesota. Boelter texted friends at a Minneapolis residence, where he had rented a room and would stay one or two nights a week, to say he had “made some choices,” the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. In the messages, read to reporters by David Carlson, Boelter did not specify what he had done but said: “I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way. … I’m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.” A former next-door neighbor in Inver Grove Heights, where Boelter used to live, said he hardly knew him but remembers his daughters because they kayaked and ice skated on the pond behind the homes. “It’s really sad for the kids, very, very nice kids,” Michael Cassidy said. He added that the suspect’s wife once came over to pray with his wife and daughter. Massive search Hundreds of police and sheriff deputies, some in tactical gear with assault-style weapons, were scattered throughout the town. Some checkpoints were set up. Police lifted a shelter-in-place order in the afternoon, saying they had reason to believe the suspect was no longer in the area. “This is crazy, someone going after representatives,” said Brooklyn Park resident Douglas Thompson, 62. “This is wrong. I’m hoping they’ll catch them.” Political violence Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican from Cold Spring, called the attack “evil” and said she was “heartbroken beyond words” by the killings. The shootings are the latest in a series of attacks against lawmakers across parties. In April a suspect set fire to the home of Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, forcing him and his family to flee during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The suspect said he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he found him, according to court documents.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday. WATCH: Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar reflects on legacy of slain state lawmaker The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offenses. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder. “Boelter planned his attack carefully” by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives. Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial. Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said. “This was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,” said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. “One man’s unthinkable actions have altered the state of Minnesota,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after Boelter’s arrest. The search for Boelter was the “largest manhunt in the state’s history,” Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman’s home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled. A photo posted by the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office appears to show Vance Luther Boelter, 57, the suspected gunman in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, in custody, at an unidentified location, released June 15, 2025. Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office via Facebook/Handout via Reuters Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him. During the search, police said they received information confirming someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He surrendered to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said. Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail at 1:02 a.m. Central Time Monday and include two mug shots, one from the front and one from the side, of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt. A targeted attack Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would’ve continued had Brooklyn Park officers not checked on Hortman’s home, causing Boelter to flee. The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter’s arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 just after 2 a.m. to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans’ home. Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home, the complaint says. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter’s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials. A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.

It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter’s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials. A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.

Walz to Minnesota lawmakers’ shootings Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other. Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn’t say what he had done. “I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” he wrote in messages viewed by AP. An escalation in political violence The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned. “This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said Sunday. On Sunday evening, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar shared a statement from Yvette Hoffman expressing appreciation for the outpouring of public support.

I took 8 and we are both incredibly lucky to be alive. We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark.” Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, “You were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.” Pam Stein came with flowers and knelt by the memorial. An emotional Stein called Hortman an “absolute powerhouse” and “the real unsung hero of Minnesota government.” Karnowski reported from Minneapolis, and Balsamo and Durkin Richer reported from Washington.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON — The lawyers for wrongly deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia late Wednesday requested civil fines be levied against Trump administration officials for repeatedly ignoring court orders — including from the U.S. Supreme Court — to bring their client back from El Salvador to the United States.\nIn the filing, the attorneys asked Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis to impose court sanctions on the government for evading discovery requests that attempted to determine steps taken to return Abrego Garcia. The Trump administration has admitted his deportation to a notorious mega-prison in March was an “administrative error.”\n“For nine weeks, the Government defied this Court’s order, affirmed by a unanimous Supreme Court, to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States following his illegal removal to El Salvador,” according to the filing.\nIn addition to fines on the government for failing to comply with court orders, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers suggest “Courts may impose monetary sanctions against government attorneys personally” and “The court may go even further and prohibit the government from reimbursing its attorneys for their costs.”\nAnd they note the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals “has affirmed civil contempt sanctions for parties that have evinced ‘disregard for the discovery process,’ such as by failing to produce discovery materials pursuant to a court order, that mirrors the conduct of the Government in the instant case.”\nTiming for Tennessee indictment questioned\nAbrego Garcia was brought back to the United States on June 6, but to face a criminal indictment on the accusation he took part in human smuggling of people in the country without legal authorization. He is currently detained and will face an arraignment before a Nashville judge Friday.\nHis attorneys questioned the timing of the indictment, noting that while Attorney General Pam Bondi “declined, when asked by reporters, to state when the criminal investigation began, public reporting indicates that it started in April—around the same time that this Court ordered expedited discovery into the Government’s apparent defiance of Court orders.”\n“While the Government was telling this Court one thing and the world something else, it was secretly working to charge Abrego Garcia with two felony immigration charges based on alleged conduct that occurred years ago—and that it previously trumpeted in the media as justifying his removal,” according to the filing.\nThe attorneys specifically cite possible sanctions against Department of Homeland Security attorney Joseph N. Mazzara, based on a New York Times story where Mazzara allegedly said the Trump administration was trying to keep Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.\n“Divining the identities of these officials is made difficult by the noncompliance itself—although at least a few, such as Mazzara, are already known—which is why it is appropriate for the Court to order an investigation into which Government officials willfully evaded the Court’s discovery orders,” according to the filing.\nContinuing the court case\nThe attorneys are pushing to continue with the discovery process in order to identify the steps taken or the involvement of any other government officials who defied the court orders to return Abrego Garcia.\n“The lengths the Government has gone to resist discovery relating to these core questions raises a strong inference that the Government is trying to hide its conduct from the scrutiny of this Court, the Plaintiffs, and the public,” according to the filing. “What the Government improperly seeks to hide must be exposed for all to see.”\nThe Trump administration on June 6 moved to dismiss Abrego Garcia’s civil suit filed in federal district court in Maryland, arguing it is moot after Abrego Garcia landed in the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee.\nBut Abrego Garcia’s lawyers are pushing to keep his civil case open in pursuit of the potential sanctions cited in the latest brief.\n“Until the Government is held accountable for its blatant, willful, and persistent violations of court orders at excruciating cost to Abrego Garcia and his family, this case is not over,” according to the brief by Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed Sunday.\nLast updated 1:28 p.m., Jun. 12, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

(AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges during an arraignment in federal court in Tennessee on Friday. Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living legally in the United States before he was wrongfully deported in March. His case has become a rallying point for opposition to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. Facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Trump administration brought him back last week. However, he was immediately taken into custody on new criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. In court filings, prosecutors accused him of being a dangerous member of the notorious MS-13 gang, but the charges against him are only for transporting people who were in the country illegally. Still, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. He is accused of transporting hundreds of people over many years, and the maximum sentence for transporting each person is 10 years. Before the hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia’s wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked three months since the Trump administration “abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.” Her voice choked with emotion, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she saw her husband for the first time on Thursday. She said, “Kilmar wants you to have faith,” and asked the people supporting him and his family “’to continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.’” Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living in the United States for more than a decade before he was wrongfully deported by the Republican administration in March. The expulsion violated a 2019 U.S. immigration judge’s order that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he likely faced gang persecution there. While the Trump administration described the mistaken removal as “an administrative error,” officials have continued to justify it by insisting Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His wife and attorneys have denied the allegations, saying he’s simply a construction worker and family man. Trump’s administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last week to face criminal charges related to what it said was a human smuggling operation that transported immigrants across the country. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with eight passengers. His lawyers have called the allegations “preposterous.” U.S. attorneys have asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, describing him as a danger to the community and a flight risk. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys disagree, pointing out he was already wrongly detained in a notorious Salvadoran prison thanks to government error and arguing due process and “basic fairness” require him to be set free. The charges against Abrego Garcia are human smuggling. But in their request to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, U.S. attorneys also accuse him of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims, although he is not charged with such crimes. The U.S. attorneys also accuse Abrego Garcia of taking part in a murder in El Salvador. However, none of those allegations is part of the charges against him, and at his initial appearance June 6, the judge warned prosecutors she cannot detain someone based solely on allegations. One of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys last week characterized the claims as a desperate attempt by the Trump administration to justify the mistaken deportation three months after the fact. “There’s no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,” private attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. In a Wednesday court filing, Abrego Garcia’s public defenders argued the government is not even entitled to a detention hearing — much less detention — because the charges against him aren’t serious enough. Although the maximum sentence for smuggling one person is 10 years, and Abrego Garcia is accused of transporting hundreds of people over nearly a decade, his defense attorneys point out there’s no minimum sentence. The average sentence for human smuggling in 2024 was just 15 months, according to court filings. The decision to charge Abrego Garcia criminally prompted the resignation of Ben Schrader, who was chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. He posted about his departure on social media on the day of the indictment, writing, “It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I’ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.” He did not directly address the indictment and declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. However, a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter confirmed the connection. Although Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland, he’s being charged in Tennessee based on a May 2022 traffic stop for speeding in the state. The Tennessee Highway Patrol body camera video of the encounter that was released to the public last month shows a calm exchange between officers and Abrego Garcia. It also shows the officers discussing among themselves their suspicions of human smuggling before sending him on his way.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to his native El Salvador three months ago, was brought back to the U.S. on Friday and will face federal charges, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said.\nAbrego Garcia’s case had become a flashpoint in a debate over what due process rights protect immigrants from deportation after federal officials conceded he was sent to a notorious El Salvador mega-prison because of an administrative error.\nStill, President Donald Trump, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, Bondi and other administration officials said for months Abrego Garcia could not be released because of criminal conduct they had not publicly produced evidence of.\nIn a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One Friday night, Trump declined to say whether it was his decision to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., according to White House pool reports.\n“He should have never had to be returned,” Trump said. “It’s a disaster.”\nBondi said Friday a federal warrant for Abrego Garcia’s arrest on human trafficking charges compelled his release from the Salvadoran prison system.\n“Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,” Bondi said at a Department of Justice news conference Friday afternoon. “He was a smuggler of humans and women and children.”\nThe 10-page indictment filed in the Middle District of Tennessee comes after a federal grand jury indicted him on May 21 for allegedly transporting migrants in the U.S. without legal authorization within the country.\nChris Newman, an attorney representing the Abrego Garcia family said at a virtual press event Friday that he remained skeptical of the federal charges lodged at Abrego Garcia.\n“I can tell you that we should all treat whatever charges that are being leveled against him with a high degree of suspicion,” Newman said. “We should make sure that he gets a fair (trial) in court because he’s clearly not getting a fair hearing in the court of public opinion.”\nBondi did not detail when the investigation into Abrego Garcia began, but said the federal indictment charges contained “recently found facts.”\n“This is what American justice looks like upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador,” Bondi said.\nWKRN in Nashville said Abrego Garcia’s arraignment has been scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday.\nOutcry over due process\nAbrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to the notorious mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, drew national outcry as the Trump administration clashed with a federal court that ordered the return of the Beltsville man and resisted the U.S. Supreme Court’s order to “facilitate” his return.\nDespite the orders, Trump administration officials did not appear to take any public steps to secure Abrego Garcia’s release, and at times seemed to relish their defiance of the courts.\nBondi thanked El Salvador’s government Friday for releasing Abrego Garcia in compliance with the warrant.\nThe Trump administration has argued in federal court in Maryland for months that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador and therefore cannot be returned, despite a $15 million agreement between the U.S. and the Salvadoran government to keep roughly 300 men removed from the U.S. and detained at CECOT. Abrego Garcia had been moved to a different El Salvador prison prior to his release.\nAbrego Gacia had deportation protections to his home country of El Salvador since 2019.\nHe was pulled over by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and informed that his immigration status had changed. He was later placed on one of three deportation flights on March 15 to CECOT.\nThe Trump administration admitted his removal was an “administrative error” but has since alleged that Abrego Garcia was a leader in the MS-13 gang without producing evidence in the federal civil court overseeing the suit challenging his removal.\nMaryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to press for Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the U.S., welcomed the news as a victory for due process rights.\n“As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. “The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.”\nWilliam J.

The freshman did his job.\nBut Williams, a lefty, is inheriting two baserunners with one out. Expect LSU to ask him to record these next two outs against a string of left-handed batters, then possibly turn the ninth inning over to the flamethrower Chase Shores. He was warming up in the pen too.\nFinal line for Evans: 4 ⅓ innings, 4 hits, 2 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 68 pitches.\nUPDATED, 11:43 a.m. — With two outs in the seventh, Daniel Dickinson caught a slider on the end of his bat, and it dropped into shallow right field, scoring Jared Jones from third.

The Tigers need him to string together some innings this morning.\nUPDATED, 10:07 a.m. — The weather delay put Jay Johnson in quite a pickle. Remember, should LSU lose to UCLA, it will have to turn around and play an elimination game against Arkansas at 6 p.m. tonight (weather permitting, of course). Kade Anderson and Anthony Eyanson are already burned.\nSo, what options does Johnson have?\nHe can either push all his chips into the rest of the matchup with the Bruins this morning. Or he can play it safe and decide to save one or two of his best arms in case the Tigers need them later this evening for a game against Arkansas.\nIt's a tricky situation. Johnson has to manage it well, or LSU's season could come to a sudden conclusion tonight.\nUPDATED, 9:50 a.m. — Pitching update.

Here's a refresher on where we left off last night before the weather delay.\n- In the first, the Bruins jumped on starter Anthony Eyanson early, scoring three runs on four hits.\n- Then LSU's hitters responded with four runs of their own. The highlight of that half inning was a three-run home run by Jared Jones, the star slugger who struck out a career-high five times in the Tigers' CWS opener against Arkansas.\n- LSU then added another run in the bottom of the third on a base hit by Luis Hernandez.\nThe game will resume in the top of the fourth with the Tigers leading 5-3.\nWe're not expecting to see Eyanson back on the mound today. He threw 44 pitches in three innings of work last night before the game was delayed.\nUPDATED, 10:21 p.m. — After nearly three hours of waiting for a thunderstorm to pass through the Omaha area, officials decided to suspend the game and resume it at 10:03 a.m. Tuesday.\nRead more details here.\n🚨 WEATHER UPDATES 🚨\n— NCAA Baseball (@NCAABaseball) June 17, 2025\n⛈️ https://t.co/TaWNawJJBQ#MCWS pic.twitter.com/yMQYtHZFeM\nUPDATED, 7:27 p.m. — The tarp is out, and the game is officially in a weather delay. Check back here for the latest. We'll update this story as soon as the NCAA announces a new start time.\nIt's 5-3 LSU at the start of the fourth inning.\nThe #LSU players took the field for a second but are coming back off.\n— Scott Rabalais (@RabalaisAdv) June 17, 2025\nThere's a tarp being pulled down in front of the 3B camera well on the track.\nThis isn't looking good.\nUPDATED, 7:23 p.m. — Steven Milam was called out on a pickoff attempt at second, but LSU successfully overturned the call with a challenge.\nJohn Pearson, pinch hitting for Tanner Reaves, then ends the inning on a strikeout.\nUPDATED, 7:20 p.m. — RBI single, Luis Hernandez. Grothues left an 89 mph fastball in the lower middle of the zone, and the LSU catcher slapped it through the heart of the infield. Two on now, with two outs.\nLSU up 5-3, bottom of the third.\nUPDATED, 7:15 p.m. — Starter Landon Stump walks Ethan Frey and Steven Milam, and UCLA makes a pitching change. The new guy on the bump is Chris Grothues, a left-handed redshirt sophomore who's worked 31 innings this season.\nUPDATED, 7:05 p.m. — Three up, three down for UCLA in the top of the third inning. Nice play by Daniel Dickinson there to get the throw to first. LSU still up 4-3 as we head into the bottom of the third.\nUPDATED, 7:00 p.m. — We're monitoring weather in Omaha. The game is still going for now, but a line of storms appears to be encroaching on the area.

Tigers' lead is still 4-3.\nUPDATED, 6:53 p.m. — Anthony Eyanson just plunked a UCLA batter. He hasn't had his best stuff today, largely because he's had trouble locating his slider. That time, he left it on the shoulder of Bruin nine-hole hitter Phoenix Call.\nHowever, UCLA couldn't take advantage. The second was a much-needed scoreless frame for Eyanson, who struck out the last hitter with a nicely thrown breaking ball.\nLSU is up 4-3 in the bottom of the second.\nUPDATED, 6:38 p.m. — Three-run home run by Jared Jones. Now LSU has the lead.\nThat homer had to feel good for Jones, who struck out a career-high five times on Saturday vs. Arkansas. At practice on Sunday, coach Jay Johnson took a few minutes to talk to Jones about his swing. Then the junior stayed around for after his teammates had boarded the bus to squeeze in an extra round of batting practice.\nThat extra work has already paid off.\nLSU is up 4-3 at the start of the second.\nJared Jones getting in some extra cage work after practice … look out! pic.twitter.com/ju1alFiVb6\n— Scott Rabalais (@RabalaisAdv) June 15, 2025\nUPDATED, 6:36 p.m. — Thanks to a beautiful hit by Steven Milam and a timely single by Jake Brown, LSU has its first run of the game. Milam dropped his hit just inches inside fair territory in right field, pushing Ethan Frey to third. Then Brown slapped a grounder up the middle to drive him home.\nUCLA up 3-1.\nUPDATED, 6:25 p.m. — LSU gets out of the first inning after it allowed UCLA to score three runs. Two of those runs were driven in by grounders, including a short dribbler to pitcher Anthony Eyanson. Not a good start for the Tigers, who allowed only one run on just three hits Saturday against Arkansas.\nAfter the top half of the first, the Bruins have three runs on four hits. Eyanson, a starter with a 2.74 ERA, threw 23 pitches in his first frame.\nT1: A lot of these ground balls have been well-placed but Eyanson doesn't have a good feel for his slider now, and he's left some balls up.\n— Koki Riley (@KokiRiley) June 16, 2025\nThat last hit was a low fastball that AJ Salgado turned into an infield single. Another run scores to make it 2-0 Bruins. #LSU https://t.co/aFTgHx21bj\nUPDATED, 6:23 p.m. — Another run for UCLA. This time, another hard-hit grounder drove it in. LSU second baseman Daniel Dickson made a diving stop to prevent it from breaking into the outfield, but another run came across, and there wasn't time for a throw to first. Eyanson has now allowed four hits and two runs.\nOnly one out. UCLA up 2-0 in the top of the first.\nUPDATED, 6:20 p.m. — UCLA cleanup hitter Roman Martin saw a slider inside, then drove it for a line-drive double into left field. One Bruin scored.

Not the start LSU wanted.\nUCLA has a 1-0 lead early.\nUPDATED, 6:19 p.m. —Two early hits for UCLA. Its leadoff hitter bounced an infield single to second base, then its three-hole batter slapped a grounder through the left side. Two on, one out.

Most notable change for LSU is that Josh Pearson is leading off, and Derek Curiel is batting sixth.\nRemember, Jay Johnson drew up a similar order for the Tigers' NCAA super-regional opener against West Virginia, and it paid off.

It's an inside look at how he turned himself into a player coach Jay Johnson has called \"the engine\" of the Tigers' offense.",
            "LSU baseball picks up where it left off, earning massive win over UCLA on Tuesday at CWS. OMAHA, Neb. — In the third inning Monday night, LSU was in good shape.\nThe Tigers led 5-3 over UCLA in the winner's bracket of the 2025 College World Series. Their second ace, junior right-hander Anthony Eyanson, had settled into the game with two scoreless innings after surrendering three runs in the first. A win would secure another day off and place LSU a victory away from reaching the CWS final.\nThen the weather came.\nJust before the start of the fourth inning, lightning and rain lit up the night sky for two hours and 53 minutes. The matchup was suspended at 10:13 p.m.\nMardi Gras Mike travels to Omaha\nMonday's game was given a restart of 10:03 a.m. Tuesday. A loss to UCLA would force the Tigers to play again Tuesday versus Arkansas in an elimination game.\nLSU needed someone to reverse its misfortune. That's when LSU coach Jay Johnson turned to Casan Evans. The freshman right-hander toed the rubber to begin the restarted game and excelled, allowing just two runs in 4⅓ innings to guide LSU past the Bruins 9-5.\n\"Coach Johnson had told me that once we got out of the delay that I would be on the mound, and then it got rolled over to today,\" Evans said. \"Just went back to the hotel and got ready for today. Woke up early.\"\nWith the win, LSU will face the winner of Tuesday night's elimination game between UCLA and Arkansas at 6 p.m. Wednesday.\nTuesday's win marks the eighth time LSU has started its College World Series run with a 2-0 record. In the seven previous instances, the Tigers won the national title six times.\n\"Great win for our team,\" Johnson said. \"Really proud of them — the mindset piece, the disruption of the game last night because of weather.\"\nEvans had five strikeouts and didn't allow an extra-base hit. He consistently fooled UCLA hitters with his split changeup and pounded the strike zone, issuing no walks and hitting one batter.\n\"I love the tempo that Casan set today,\" Johnson said. \"I thought he was outstanding, as he always is.\"\nHe eventually exited for freshman left-hander Cooper Williams after two hitters reached with one out in the eighth inning.\nWilliams struggled in his first appearance in Omaha. The Texas native walked two batters and allowed both inherited runners to score. The two runs cut LSU's lead to 8-5 before redshirt sophomore right-hander Chase Shores entered with two outs and the bases loaded.\nShores needed just one pitch to end the jam, forcing a fielder's choice groundout to sophomore Steven Milam at shortstop. He then breezed through the ninth inning to end the game.\n\"It felt amazing,\" Shores said when asked about the one-pitch out in the eighth. \"I mean, if I can do it in one pitch (and) you save my pitch count, that's even better.\"\nThe LSU bats produced during the restart, scoring four runs with two outs.\nRun-scoring singles from Milam and sophomore Jake Brown in the fourth inning stretched LSU's Monday lead to 7-3. Three innings later, junior Daniel Dickinson blooped a single into shallow right field that drove in a run before.\n\"Rough day for me, it's all good,\" Dickinson said regarding his bloop hit. \"We'll take them whenever you can.\"\nJunior Jared Jones drove in his fourth run of the game in the eighth with a single that gave LSU a 9-5 advantage.\nBefore the rain began to fall, LSU tallied four runs in the first inning and added another score in the third after falling behind 3-0.\nThe Tigers hit three consecutive singles in the first that resulted in a run-scoring hit by Brown. Two pitches later, Jones blasted a three-run home run to the opposite field that turned LSU's 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 lead.\nJones' homer was his 21st of the season and LSU's first in Omaha. The blast traveled 387 feet and was launched 110 mph into the teeth of the wind in right-center field.\nThe hit was his first of the College World Series after he went 0 for 5 with five strikeouts in LSU's win against Arkansas on Saturday.\n\"Offensively, we just wanted to start the game on the right note,\" Jones said. \"We talk about winning every inning. Obviously, they put up a three spot in the top half, so to win the inning we've got to put up at least four.\"\nThe Tigers added a fifth run in the third on senior Luis Hernandez's two-out single. The tally gave LSU a 5-3 lead before the game was stopped because of the weather.\nMilam, Jones and Brown led the Tigers with multiple hits apiece. Jones' home run was their only extra-base hit, but only one starter — redshirt junior Tanner Reaves — failed to record a hit.\n\"I think it kind of can go unnoticed with our team. It's more than talent. It's really skilled baseball players, and (Milam's) at the top of that,\" Johnson said. \"So when you have that kind of skill, you can make adjustments quickly and usually not stay down for long.\"\nEyanson's rocky start put LSU behind the eight ball Monday. The UC San Diego transfer surrendered three runs on three singles and a double in the first inning.\nHis fastball was up to 96 mph, but UCLA hitters were not fooled by his slider even if he did improve as the game continued. Eyanson retired six of the last seven batters he faced.\n\"I was getting ready to throw a warm-up on the mound (and) the umpire kind of screamed at me, saying, 'Hey, time to come off the field,' \" Eyanson said about Monday. \"I didn't really know it was going to rain (Monday) at all. I didn't really check the weather. But yeah, it kind of sucked.\""

            "Trump and Musk’s Dramatic Falling Out Displays the Hazards of Billionaire Rule. Is the Donald Trump-Elon Musk bromance finally over? President Trump is threatening to cut off billions of dollars in federal contracts with Musk after the two billionaires engaged in a dramatic online feud just days after Musk called Trump’s budget bill a “disgusting abomination.” Musk appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and claimed the president is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. “They are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos,” says author Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, who is working on a new book about Elon Musk. “This is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put … the whole future of the American economy and the political scene in the hands of two sole human beings.”\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who, up until just recently, was a top presidential adviser and Trump’s top political benefactor. The fight could have broad implications for Trump’s presidency, the Republican Party and many government programs, including NASA, that rely on technology from Musk’s various companies. The feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump’s so-called big, beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” because it will increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion. The tension then escalated considerably on Thursday.\nDuring a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a reporter asked Trump about Musk’s comment. This is part of his response.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. … He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I’m sure you can get very easily — it’s very fresh, on tape — he said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that’ll be next. But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.\nAMY GOODMAN: The feud then spilled into social media, with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms, Musk on X and Trump on Truth Social.\nAt 2:37 p.m. Thursday, Trump wrote, “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” unquote.\nAt 3:10 p.m., Musk wrote, quote, “Time to drop the really big bomb, @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”\nThen Trump wrote, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump said.\nMusk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency.\nTrump ally Steve Bannon went further, calling for Musk to be investigated and deported. He also called Trump to seize Musk’s company SpaceX.\nTo talk more about the fracturing of the Trump-Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican Party, we’re joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism. He is author of Hayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right, as well as Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy.\nProfessor Slobodian, welcome back to Democracy Now! Were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday? I mean, who knows? They could be holding a joint news conference soon and announce they’re back in love.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos. And I think that, more than anything, this is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put billions of dollars, even the lives of astronauts, the whole future of the American economy and the political scene, in the hands of two sole human beings.\nAMY GOODMAN: When you said threaten the lives of astronauts, explain.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, the Dragon unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from where they are now. So, were he to decommission it, it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there, kind of Gravity style.\nSo, this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers, that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing, that we feel more and more exposed to, from the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of the same internet connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government. I feel like, over time, we’ll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness, and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let’s go from the threat to lives in space to here on the ground, Elon Musk taking on the budget, calling it an “abomination.” When Trump said he knows that — the budget bill better than almost anyone else, inside and out, Musk’s response was, “That is false. I never saw it. It was passed in the middle of the night.” Can you talk about the significance? I mean, this is the guy in charge of DOGE. How many thousands of jobs have been lost? And yet, at the same time now he’s viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed, and it could threaten its ultimate passage.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I mean, I think it’s worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump — right? — what he was doing with this DOGE project. And I think it’s possible to kind of split it up into three categories.\nI think, first of all, he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy. So, I think, especially on the trade war and his many, many interests in China, you know, he has a Gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year. He wanted to get out in front of any possible excess of economic nationalism that might be rolled out.\nAnd then I think he was kind of making a Hail Mary move, that, you know, he hadn’t really clicked with the Biden administration, and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations, especially in artificial intelligence, where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Altman and OpenAI.\nAnd then, third, I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy, where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services, especially SpaceX, to, in fact, not only get to the moon, but divert the whole project towards Mars. So, there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved.\nBut from Trump’s point of view, he’s never really been a fiscal hawk, right? He’s always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined GOP politics for the last couple decades. So it was always kind of an odd fit, and it’s not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is, you know, not hard austerity enough for his liking. It’s telling, for example, that he’s posted multiple Milton Friedman memes over the last couple of days, sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government. But Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology.\nAnd the question is: Why now has this led to a snapping point —\nAMY GOODMAN: So —\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: — for Musk? And I think there’s a —\nAMY GOODMAN: Keep going.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: If I could just say, I think there’s a couple of things there. I think Trump invokes the EV mandate, and that is a serious issue, right? What that is — it needs to be broken down — is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time, a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows normal ICE — internal combustion engine — vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers. And this is now 40% of Tesla’s net income in the last year. It went up a billion dollars in the last year alone. And if that gets killed, it really does kind of kill Tesla’s margin. And I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD, battery producers like CATL. And I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand, as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum. So, there’s reasons, as he returns to his businesses, to start to sweat about what he’s actually signed up for.\nAMY GOODMAN: How about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement, and where JD Vance fits into this, the vice president?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, it’s always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with DOGE, right? I mean, if you want to get into the real kind of Dangerous Liaisons kind of courtesanship, I think, that is happening inside of the White House, it seems that, based on reporting, Stephen Miller was kind of stage managing, along with his wife, a lot of what was happening with DOGE.\nAnd if you look at what actually came out of DOGE — and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or postmortem on it, as it winds down, really — he said he was going to do 2 trillion cut — $2 trillion in cuts, out of a $6 trillion budget — very unlikely — went back to $1 trillion, scaled it back to $150 billion. What did they end up taking out? I mean, it’s basically culture war stuff, right? I mean, it’s ways to trigger the progressives and the libs — get rid of USAID, attack NEH funding, arts funding, science funding, education, energy. These ended up being big wins not really for Musk’s own bottom-line, cost-cutting mentality, but very much for the culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. So there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view. They were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed, you know, brilliant, Edison-like inventor and wonderful, efficiency-creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals.\nBut they never could bring that big number down. Why? Because entitlement spending still dominates the state spending in the GDP. And when you come close to that, you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract. And we saw the town hall meetings. We saw the anger when things started to encroach on the questions of Social Security and Medicaid. And for me, that was a very telling moment, and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise, too. He’s not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back. He’s used to interacting with a Twitter fan base, a set of really bought-in Tesla investors, for whom, you know, he always walks on water and he’s a god reincarnate. And when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal, he didn’t know what to do.\nSo, I think that there’s a kind of a — there’s a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives. They got to do some of their their easy wins against the progressives and the libs, and now they’re able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of spending, as we see in the so-called big, beautiful bill.\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his DOGE army downloaded from all the agencies? Is that possible?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I am not a software programmer, and I do not know how databases work that well, but it seems at least likely that part of what they were doing there, when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them, was also harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don’t know what. Feeding the machine of Grok or xAI is the most likely answer.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, let me ask you: Steve Bannon, who’s on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift, has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk’s businesses and for him to be deported, right? I mean, Elon Musk comes from South Africa.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, this actually isn’t the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said. He referred to Silicon Valley as an “apartheid state” a few months ago. The idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one. It would certainly run against the core privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades. So far, I would chalk that up to just saber-rattling rhetoric for his podcast, more than an actual policy proposal.\nAMY GOODMAN: Quinn Slobodian, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University.

            "Trump just took his public feud with Musk to a new level: Going after his money. Trump just took his public feud with Musk to a new level: Going after his money\nMusk announced his company SpaceX will withdraw from service its Dragon spacecraft — critical to the American space program.\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday threatened Elon Musk’s federal contracts, a remarkable escalation in a public feud between the president and the world’s richest man, his former ally.\n“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Thursday afternoon. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”\nThe president’s relationship with Musk has deteriorated rapidly since Musk left the White House last week. The acrimony went public when Musk publicly slammed Trump’s sweeping domestic policy package on Tuesday.\nMusk responded to the broadside by announcing his company, SpaceX, will withdraw from service its Dragon spacecraft — which is critical to the American space program.\n“In light of President Trump’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk wrote on X, the social media site he owns.\nMusk’s threat would deprive the U.S. of its only assured way of supplying the International Space Station and bringing on and off astronauts. If executed, NASA would instead have to rely on Russia to bring supplies and astronauts to the station. NASA had contracted with Boeing on the Starliner, a competitor to the Dragon spacecraft, but that system is temporarily out of service following problems with the craft.\nBut he seemingly walked away from that threat late Thursday. Responding to an X user pleading for the two men to “cool off and take a step back for a couple days,” Musk said “ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”\nHe’s continued to lash out at the White House in the days since — with Musk baiting Trump by name earlier Thursday, and Trump responding by chastising the Tesla CEO from the Oval Office later in the day.\nStill, Trump’s criticism from the White House — where the two men less than a week ago shared a laudatory sendoff for Musk — was not as pointed as the president’s barbs on social media.\n“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote on X Thursday. “Such ingratitude.”\nMusk’s companies have significant ties to the federal government, even before the Trump administration. SpaceX is one of NASA’s largest contractors. And his car company Tesla benefitted from a clean energy subsidy that is on the chopping block in Republicans’ reconciliation package.\n“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted.\n“Such an obvious lie. So sad,” Musk fired back.\nTrump has previously boosted Tesla because of his close relationship with Musk. In March, with the company’s stock at a low after public anger over job cuts fueled by Musk’s DOGE initiative, the president toured different Tesla models at a makeshift car show on the White House lawn. Trump later purchased his own Tesla, “a show of confidence and support” for Musk.\nTesla’s stock tanked on Thursday, falling more than 14 percent as the two traded barbs.\nTrump has routinely wielded the power of the executive branch against institutions that he deems are misbehaving. He’s frozen billions in federal grants to some of the country’s top universities, Harvard chief among them, as punishment for alleged antisemitism and civil rights violations. And he’s secured multimillion dollar deals with law firms weary of his threats to tank their business.\nSam Skove contributed to this report.",
            "Elon Musk goes on a warpath against Trump and the GOP. Elon Musk goes on a warpath against Trump and the GOP\nThe fallout from the very public breakup could engulf Republican hopes of holding onto the House.\nElon Musk just launched a war against the GOP. Now the party’s hopes of holding onto power are at stake.\nMusk has gone from helping Republicans take total control of Washington — spending nearly $300 million to become the single biggest known donor last year — to attacking the highest-ranking leaders of the party and daring the rank and file to cross him.\n“Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,” Musk said on X.\nThe post was an unambiguous warning from the world’s richest man, who has the power to single-handedly reshape elections with his wealth. It was not long ago that Republicans hoped Musk could pour cash into their efforts to help maintain control of Washington. Instead, he’s becoming their public adversary.\nMusk spent Thursday online attacking President Donald Trump over Republicans’ massive tax-and-spending bill, which Musk says does not cut enough government spending.\nHe’d already threatened to challenge Republicans who support the megabill; on Thursday, he blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, took credit for Republicans winning trifecta control in November, and floated the idea of launching a third party.\n“This is a massive crack in the MAGA coalition,” said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and a former Trump administration appointee. “This town is historically built on Republican versus Democrat, and this seems to be crazy versus crazy. It is asymmetric and it seems, for the first time, President Trump seems to be out-crazied.”\nJust a few weeks ago, Republicans were still praising Musk for his financial backing in the 2024 election as they hoped he’d make a graceful return to the private sector after overseeing the administration’s program to slash federal spending. Less than one week ago, Musk was in the Oval Office with Trump commemorating his time in administration as a special government employee.\nBut that polite departure, it quickly became evident, was not going to happen.\n“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, blaming Musk’s anger on the megabill’s removal of electric vehicle tax credits. “He just went CRAZY!”\nAs Musk’s drama engulfed the party Thursday, Republicans in Congress mostly tried to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Key GOP lawmakers in both chambers worked to downplay the potential effects on both the party’s domestic policy package and on the GOP’s midterms posture.\nRep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who leads the House GOP campaign arm, told reporters Thursday that he hopes the spat will “blow over.” Before the breakup went nuclear, Hudson had said in a brief interview Wednesday evening that Musk has “been a friend and he’s just wrong about this bill.”\nEven fiscal hard-liners who have embraced some of Musk’s talking points about the bill tried to avoid getting drawn into the fracas. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who at one point threatened to tank the megabill for not being fiscally conservative enough, said, “Elon crossed the line today ... we’ll let those guys go play it out.”\n“I don’t disagree with him about our need to find more spending cuts,” Roy added, but Musk needs to “keep it in the lines.”\nAnother hard-liner, Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), said he believes Musk is losing sway within MAGA. Musk is “just another shiny object,” he said, “and we’ll deal with it.”\nBut Musk appeared intent on turning his opposition to the legislation into a civil war for the party. He amplified two Kentucky Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul, who have been thorns in the side of Trump and GOP leaders trying to pass the bill.\nEven though Musk brought massive financial backing, he has also at times been an electoral problem for Republicans. His popularity has fallen below Trump’s, and his biggest political effort this year — the Wisconsin Supreme Court race — ended with the conservative candidate losing by almost 10 points.\n“Elon couldn’t buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. You really think that people are gonna be afraid of this money?” said a person close to the White House, granted anonymity to discuss the dynamics.\nAs Musk’s popularity faded, Republicans wondered how long his relationship with Trump could endure. On Thursday, Musk severed ties.\nHe took shot after shot at Trump, accusing him of lying, replying “yes” to a post suggesting he should be impeached, and accusing him of having a cozy relationship with the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, who had been accused of sex trafficking.\n“What a predictable shitshow,” said a person who has been in the room with both Musk and Trump. “Trump is a liar, and it was obvious Elon would not be able to go along with his incessant lying forever.”\nA nervous Republican Party is now scrambling to figure out what the electoral fallout will look like, starting with next year’s midterms.\nAlready, two of Trump’s top campaign operatives, Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio had signed up to work with Musk’s Building America’s Future PAC. But Musk’s scorched-earth strategy could create dueling allegiances.\nPrivately, some Republicans are arguing they had already been preparing for next year’s elections without Musk’s money, and complained that America PAC — the tech billionaire’s super PAC — didn’t spend its money effectively in House races last year.\nAmerica PAC spent $19.2 million backing GOP candidates across 18 battleground House races last year, according to data from the Federal Election Commission. Republicans won 10 of those elections. But those were among the highest-profile and most expensive races in the country, and Musk’s group accounted for only 12 percent of Republican outside spending in them. It wasn’t even the biggest GOP spender — that was still the Congressional Leadership Fund, the primary super PAC affiliated with House Republicans.\n“What Elon has is money, and if he’s not going to put $100 million in the [midterms], that’s a hole that has to be filled,” said Chris Mottola, a GOP media consultant. “On the other hand, there was a question about how effective the money was that he spent, because he spent it the way he wanted to.”\nOver the last few months, Musk has floated the idea of getting involved in the midterms, but he’s also claimed he would step back from political spending. If Musk is going to go all-in against the party, he’s going to need more than money.\n“Are there enough good Republican operatives out there to go achieve this mission for Elon Musk when it means going up against the president?” said a former RNC official, granted anonymity to discuss the situation candidly. “Everybody’s got a price, but I don’t think they are rushing to go help Elon further divide the Republican Party ahead of the midterms.”\nLisa Kashinsky, Jessica Piper, Holly Otterbein, Dasha Burns, Nicholas Wu, Sophia Cai, Jordain Carney and Meredith Lee Hill contributed to this report."

            "Congress hears of rewards, security risks of government use of AI. 10:00\nrepublished\nCongress hears of rewards, security risks of government use of AI\nAI experts told the House Oversight Committee that AI offers enormous promise for federal workers, but also raises serious privacy and security concerns. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\nAs Congress continues its investigation into the role AI should play in government, members of the House Oversight Committee are questioning the uses and procurement of AI tools for government work, as well as the privacy concerns the technology poses when unregulated.\nExpert witnesses testified at a June 5 hearing that the federal government is currently using AI in some capacities, but several factors, such as the government’s outdated technology systems and data practices, could keep federal workers from using the technology to its full potential. They also said the government’s current procurement practices for AI technology slow its adoption, which risks other countries taking the lead in the global AI race.\n“The question before us is not whether the federal government should adopt AI, it’s whether we will lead or follow,” Bhavin Shah, founder and CEO of Moveworks, an AI company that contracts with both private companies and local governments.\nMany federal departments are using AI that has been approved under the current procurement standards, like The Department of Health and Human Services, which uses AI in medical research and tracking disease outbreaks, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses AI to help analyze medical records and data to predict risk-related incidents of suicide.\nShah said in his testimony that the federal government workers “deserve” the same quick access to AI-powered tools that the private sector is using to maintain efficiency and cost savings. He said Moveworks spent three and a half years and $8.5 million to achieve FedRAMP status, the standardized approach the federal government uses to assess security of cloud-based tools.\n“This is a prohibitive barrier for smaller AI innovators, the companies that often develop the most cutting-edge solutions,” Shah said.\nYlli Bajraktari, president and CEO of tech-focused think tank Special Competitive Studies Project, said that while the U.S. still leads in AI research, the slow adoption of AI into government use is our “primary disadvantage,” against countries like China.\n“We are hampered by bureaucratic inertia, outdated IT infrastructure and a lack of AI literacy in the workforce,” Bajraktari said. “Overcoming these barriers is the key to winning the global tech competition.”\nBajraktari’s suggestions to the committee included establishing a “space race” style council for AI in the White House, increasing non-defense AI research and development spending to $32 billion and launching a targeted AI talent strategy that would promote AI literacy and attract top STEM talent from abroad. He also suggested overhauling the procurement process to more quickly integrate AI into government systems and strengthening global alliances in AI and cybersecurity.\nBut the oversimplification and speedy adoption of AI in government is a major security and data privacy risk, testified Bruce Schneier, a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. Schneier warned congressmembers that recent actions by Elon Musk — who just stepped down as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, this week — highlight the dangers of unfettered AI use.\nIn February, Musk said the DOGE team was using AI to help make decisions about federal workers’ jobs. DOGE also reportedly had gained access to sensitive data from various federal departments, like the Treasury Department payment system, Social Security and other demographic data. In April, 48 lawmakers expressed their concerns with Musk using unauthorized AI systems on these and other datasets.\nMusk’s actions go against what the committee aimed to do, Schneier said, which is release AI responsibly, and protect the interests and rights of Americans. Americans’ data has been consolidated and fed to non-vetted AI models, he said, which poses national security risks.\n“You all need to assume that our adversaries have copies of all the data DOGE has exfiltrated and have established access into all the networks that DOGE has removed security controls from,” Schneier said. “And your data can be used against you.”\nMusk’s actions and access to Americans’ data, and his reported drug use, were the center of a 40-minute debate before the June 5 hearing, where Republicans once again blocked Democrats in a 21-20 vote to attempt to force Musk to testify before Congress.\n“He’s dismantled our government, endangered Americans and weaponized public service for his own financial gain,” said Rep. Stephen Lynch a Democrat from Massachusets and the acting ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.\nLinda Miller, founder and chief growth officer at TrackLight, a platform that performs fraud detection for government programs, said in her testimony that DOGE’s actions are an example of why it’s challenging to impose private sector innovation on governments.\n“My fellow panelists have made some very smart suggestions about turbocharging the rip and replace efforts of legacy IT systems and removing procurement barriers, but we have to be realistic about how capable government is to enact these rapid changes, no matter how badly they’re needed,” she said.\nMiller said the best uses of AI in government work today should be automating routine processes and repetitive tasks, which would free federal workers up for more high level work. She recommended that to speed AI adoption, Congress may consider supporting “regulatory sandboxes” — controlled environments where AI systems can be tried and tested under supervision of regulators before they are released at scale.\n“Wholesale changes to legacy IT systems and the federal acquisition system will take years, but we can create innovative laboratories where AI projects can operate in proof of concept regulatory sandboxes, in carefully controlled environments, to start to show the art of the possible,” Miller said.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Meta invests in AI firm Scale and recruits its CEO for 'superintelligence' team\nMeta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence” at the tech giant\nMeta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing “superintelligence” at the tech giant.\nThe deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.\nMeta announced what it called a “strategic partnership and investment” with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.\nScale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will “substantially expand Scale and Meta’s commercial relationship.” Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.\nWang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale’s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company’s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.\nZuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of “superintelligence” — which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI — is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.\nIt won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.\nGoogle pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept’s AI systems and datasets.\nWang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.\nThey won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.\nScale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.\nWhat Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.\nMore recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models — the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama — brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service “every leading large language model,” including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.\nWang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.\nMeta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.\nIt hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.”\nMeta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.\n“How do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?” LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.\nThese are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models “basically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,” LeCun said.\nInstead, he emphasized Meta's interest in “tracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.” When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has “always been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.”\n“It’s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,” he said.\nLeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.\nFergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research “remains unwavering” and described the work as “building human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.”",

You're not going to lose your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to someone who uses AI,\" chipmaker Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said at the Milken Institute's Global Conference in May.\n\"What used to be human-coded softwares running on CPUs are now machine learning generated softwares running on GPUs,\" Huang said at The Hill and Valley Forum in April.\nBut he added that \"every single layer, the tooling of it, the compilers of it, the methodology of it, the way you collect data, curate data, use AI to guard rails, use AI to teach, use AI to keep the AI safe, all of that technology is being invented right now and it creates tons of jobs.\"\nDuolingo CEO Luis von Ahn: Respond to AI with curiosity, not fear\n\"I don't know exactly what's going to happen with AI, but I do know it's going to fundamentally change the way we work, and we have to get ahead of it,\" Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn said on LinkedIn earlier this year.\nHe was responding to a backlash against previous comments about enthusiastically embracing AI.\n\"AI is creating uncertainty for all of us, and we can respond to this with fear or curiosity,\" the language app's CEO wrote. \"I've always encouraged our team to embrace new technology (that's why we originally built for mobile instead of desktop), and we are taking that same approach with AI.\"\nHe added: \"To be clear: I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do (we are in fact continuing to hire at the same speed as before). I see it as a tool to accelerate what we do, at the same or better level of quality. And the sooner we learn how to use it, and use it responsibly, the better off we will be in the long run.\"\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison: 'Stay close to the cash register'\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said his advice was to \"stay as close to the cash register as you can.\"\n\"When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is: stay as close to the cash register as you can,\" Ellison said at a Business Roundtable forum in DC this month.\n\"Stay close to the customers, because you will always have employment opportunities to grow,\" he added.\nHe also said, \"AI isn't going to fix a hole in your roof.\"\n\"It's not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home. It's not going to stop your water heater from leaking,\" he said.\nLinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman: Show off your AI skills to employers\n\"You are generation AI,\" LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman said in a video in which he answered questions from college students on how they should navigate the job hunt.\n\"You are AI native, so bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive,\" he added.\nHoffman said that AI's impact on jobs was a \"legitimate worry,\" but he added that students could try to use it to their advantage.\n\"Look, on this side, it's transforming the workspace, entry-level work, employers' confusion,\" he said. \"But on this side, it's making you able to show your unique capabilities.\"\n\"In an environment with a bunch of older people, you might be able to help them out,\" he added.\nLattice CEO Sarah Franklin: Bosses should give workers AI to do jobs without feeling swamped\nLattice boss Sarah Franklin told Business Insider that corporate leaders should be focused on how AI can help with efficiency.\nThe HR software company CEO said this includes using AI to give employees \"superpowers to where they feel like they're stepping into the Iron Man suit\" and accomplishing what they need to in their jobs without feeling swamped.\nShe said that might include using AI to give each employee at a company an executive assistant or a coach."

And while some troops have already gone on such missions, he said it’s too early to say if that will continue even after the protests die down.\n“We are expecting a ramp-up,” said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, noting that protests across the nation were being discussed. “I’m focused right here in LA, what’s going on right here. But you know, I think we’re, we’re very concerned.”\nHours later, a demonstration in Los Angeles’ civic center just before start of the second night of the city’s downtown curfew briefly turned chaotic when police in riot gear — many on horseback — charged at a group, striking them with wooden rods and later fired crowd control projectiles, including one that struck a woman who writhed in pain on the ground. After the curfew went into effect, a handful of arrests were made before the area cleared out and the evening quieted down.\nThe LA-area mayors and city council members urged Trump to stop using armed military troops alongside immigration agents.\n“I’m asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,” said Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount, who said she was hit by rubber bullets over the weekend. “You need to stop these raids.”\nSpeaking alongside the other mayors at a news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the raids spread fear at the behest of the White House. The city’s nightly curfew will remain in effect as long as necessary. It covers a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section of downtown where the protests have been concentrated in the city that encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).\n“If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” Bass said.\nThose who have been caught up in the nationwide raids include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court.\nThe administration has cited the protests in its decision to deploy the military.\nCalifornia's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has asked a federal court to put an emergency stop to the military helping immigration agents in the nation’s second-largest city.

He later said he based his comments on photos and footage he had seen that turned out not to be a representation of Guard members in Los Angeles.\nPolice detained more than 20 people, mostly on curfew violations, on the first night of the curfew and used crowd-control projectiles to break up hundreds of protesters. But officers were more aggressive in controlling demonstrators Wednesday evening and as the curfew took effect, police were beginning to make arrests.\nLos Angeles police have made nearly 400 arrests and detentions since Saturday, the vast majority of which were for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to the police department.\nThere have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against police officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun.

Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests Tuesday night.

The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers). Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier accused Trump of drawing a “military dragnet” across the nation’s second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard. He also deployed Marines, though none were seen on the streets Tuesday. Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities. The change moves the military closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration’s immigration crackdown.

She said it was expected to last for several days. “We reached a tipping point” after 23 businesses were looted, Bass said Tuesday. The curfew doesn’t apply to residents who live in the designated area, people who are homeless, credentialed media or public safety and emergency officials, said Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell.

It’s one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president. “If there’s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We’ll see,” he said from the Oval Office. Later the president called protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy” in a speech at Fort Bragg. Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

            "Supreme Court ends restrictions on LA immigration stops set after agents swept up U.S. citizens. Lindsay Whitehurst, Associated Press\nLindsay Whitehurst, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump’s administration at the high court.\nREAD MORE: Noem says immigration raid at Hyundai plant in Georgia won’t deter investment in the U.S.\nThe conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that “roving patrols” were conducting indiscriminate arrests in LA. The order had barred agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.\nTrump’s Republican administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\nU.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.\nThe Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.\nThe lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during hisadministration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.\nIn a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.

Read the original article. Have you been hearing about the dire wolf lately? Maybe you saw a massive white wolf on the cover of Time magazine or a photo of “Game of Thrones” author George R.R. Martin holding a puppy named after a character from his books. The dire wolf, a large, wolflike species that went extinct about 12,000 years ago, has been in the news after biotech company Colossal claimed to have resurrected it using cloning and gene-editing technologies. Colossal calls itself a “de-extinction” company. The very concept of de-extinction is a lightning rod for criticism. There are broad accusations of playing God or messing with nature, as well as more focused objections that contemporary de-extinction tools create poor imitations rather than truly resurrected species. WATCH MORE: The tough decision of which species to save from extinction While the biological and philosophical debates are interesting, the legal ramifications for endangered species conservation are of paramount importance. As a legal scholar with a Ph.D. in wildlife genetics, my work focuses on how we legally define the term “endangered species.” The use of biotechnology for conservation, whether for de-extinction or genetic augmentation of existing species, promises solutions to otherwise intractable problems. But it needs to work in harmony with both the letter and purpose of the laws governing biodiversity conservation. Of dire wolves and de-extinction What did Colossal actually do? Scientists extracted and sequenced DNA from Ice Age-era bones to understand the genetic makeup of the dire wolf. They were able to piece together around 90% of a complete dire wolf genome. While the gray wolf and the dire wolf are separated by a few million years of evolution, they share over 99.5% of their genomes. WATCH: A Brief But Spectacular take on the future of CRISPR The scientists scanned the recovered dire wolf sequences for specific genes that they believed were responsible for the physical and ecological differences between dire wolves and other species of canids, including genes related to body size and coat color. CRISPR gene-editing technology allows scientists to make specific changes in the DNA of an organism. The Colossal team used CRISPR to make 20 changes in 14 different genes in a modern gray wolf cell before implanting the embryo into a surrogate mother. A worker puts finishing touches to a life-size model of a Dire Wolf (Canis Dirus) at the Karpin Abentura park in the Karrantza valley, outside Bilbao July 26, 2014. Photo by Vincent West via Reuters. While the technology on display is marvelous, what should we call the resulting animals? Some commentators argue that the animals are just modified gray wolves. They point out that it would take far more than 20 edits to bridge the gap left by millions of years of evolution. For instance, that 0.5% of the genome that doesn’t match in the two species represents over 12 million base pair differences. More philosophically, perhaps, other skeptics argue that a species is more than a collection of genes devoid of environmental, ecological or evolutionary context. WATCH: How CRISPR gene editing puts scientists in the driver’s seat of evolution Colossal, on the other hand, maintains that it is in the “functional de-extinction” game. The company acknowledges it isn’t making a perfect dire wolf copy. Instead it wants to recreate something that looks and acts like the dire wolf of old. It prefers the “if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck” school of speciation. Disagreements about taxonomy – the science of naming and categorizing living organisms – are as old as the field itself. Biologists are notorious for failing to adopt a single clear definition of “species,” and there are dozens of competing definitions in the biological literature. Biologists can afford to be flexible and imprecise when the stakes are merely a conversational misunderstanding. Lawyers and policymakers, on the other hand, do not have that luxury. Deciding what counts as an endangered ‘species’ In the United States, the Endangered Species Act is the main tool for protecting biodiversity. To be protected by the act, an organism must be a member of an endangered or threatened species. Some of the most contentious ESA issues are definitional, such as whether the listed species is a valid “species” and whether individual organisms, especially hybrids, are members of the listed species. WATCH: What the Endangered Species Act has accomplished in 50 years Colossal’s functional species concept is anathema to the Endangered Species Act. It shrinks the value of a species down to the way it looks or the way it functions. When passing the act, however, Congress made clear that species were to be valued for their “aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people.” In my view, the myopic focus on function seems to miss the point. Despite its insistence otherwise, Colossal’s definitional sleight of hand has opened the door to arguments that people should reduce conservation funding or protections for currently imperiled species. Why spend the money to protect a critter and its habitat when, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, you can just “pick your favorite species and call up Colossal”? Putting biotechnology to work for conservation Biotechnology can provide real conservation benefits for today’s endangered species. I suggest gene editing’s real value is not in recreating facsimiles of long-extinct species like dire wolves, but instead using it to recover ones in trouble now. READ MORE: A quarter of the world’s freshwater animals are threatened with extinction, new research shows Projects, by both Colossal and other groups, are underway around the world to help endangered species develop disease resistance or evolve to tolerate a warmer world. Other projects use gene editing to reintroduce genetic variation into populations where genetic diversity has been lost. For example, Colossal has also announced that it has cloned a red wolf. Unlike the dire wolf, the red wolf is not extinct, though it came extremely close. After decades of conservation efforts, there are about a dozen red wolves in the wild in the reintroduced population in eastern North Carolina, as well as a few hundred red wolves in captivity. Red wolf pups are seen at Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, in Seattle, Washington, U.S., August 29, 2019. Photo by Katie Cotterill/Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium/Handout via Reuters. The entire population of red wolves, both wild and captive, descends from merely 14 founders of the captive breeding program. This limited heritage means the species has lost a significant amount of the genetic diversity that would help it continue to evolve and adapt. In order to reintroduce some of that missing genetic diversity, you’d need to find genetic material from red wolves outside the managed population. Right now that would require stored tissue samples from animals that lived before the captive breeding program was established or rediscovering a “lost” population in the wild. READ MORE: Why giant human-sized beavers died out 10,000 years ago Recently, researchers discovered that coyotes along the Texas Gulf Coast possess a sizable percentage of red wolf-derived DNA in their genomes. Hybridization between coyotes and red wolves is both a threat to red wolves and a natural part of their evolutionary history, complicating management. The red wolf genes found within these coyotes do present a possible source of genetic material that biotechnology could harness to help the captive breeding population if the legal hurdles can be managed. This coyote population was Colossal’s source for its cloned “ghost” red wolf. Even this announcement is marred by definitional confusion. Due to its hybrid nature, the animal Colossal cloned is likely not legally considered a red wolf at all. Under the Endangered Species Act, hybrid organisms are typically not protected. So by cloning one of these animals, Colossal likely sidestepped the need for ESA permits. It will almost certainly run into resistance if it attempts to breed these “ghost wolves” into the current red wolf captive breeding program that has spent decades trying to minimize hybridization. How much to value genetic “purity” versus genetic diversity in managed species still proves an extraordinarily difficult question, even without the legal uncertainty. Biotechnology could never solve every conservation problem – especially habitat destruction. The ability to make “functional” copies of a species certainly does not lessen the urgency to respond to biodiversity loss, nor does it reduce human beings’ moral culpability. But to adequately respond to the ever-worsening biodiversity crisis, conservationists will need all available tools. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies — visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 – had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that’s shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It’s unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said. “Sea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,” said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data. Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea. READ MORE: China blocks moves to increase protection of emperor penguins “It’s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,” said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study. There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they’re detected in a single satellite photo taken each year. The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds. “More predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,” said Fretwell. Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.

READ MORE: China blocks moves to increase protection of emperor penguins “It’s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,” said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study. There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they’re detected in a single satellite photo taken each year. The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds. “More predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,” said Fretwell. Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.

            "Death toll in Indian plane crash climbs to 270 as search teams find more bodies. Search and recovery teams continued scouring the site of one of India’s worst aviation disasters for a third day after the Air India flight fell from the sky and killed at least 270 people in Gujarat state, officials said Saturday.\nThe London-bound Boeing 787 struck a medical college hostel in a residential area of the northwestern city of Ahmedabad minutes after takeoff Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. One passenger survived.\nRecovery teams working until late Friday found at least 25 more bodies in the debris, officials said.\nDr. Dhaval Gameti at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad told The Associated Press the facility had received 270 bodies, adding that the lone surviving passenger was still under observation for some of his wounds.\n“He is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,” Gameti said Saturday.\nHundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.\nSome relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching and they are expediting the process.\n“Where are my children? Did you recover them?” asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. “I will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.”\nAnother relative persistently asked hospital staff when his relative’s body would be handed over to the family for last rites.\n“Give us the body,” the relative insisted.\nAlongside the formal investigation, the Indian government says it has formed a high-level, multi-disciplinary committee to examine the causes leading to the crash.\nThe committee will focus on formulating procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future and “will not be a substitute to other enquiries being conducted by relevant organizations,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.\nAuthorities have begun inspecting Air India’s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Indian Minister of Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday in New Delhi at his first news briefing since Thursday’s crash.\nEight of the 34 Dreamliner aircraft in India have already undergone inspection, Kinjarapu said, adding that the remaining aircraft will be examined with “immediate urgency.”\nThe government is eagerly awaiting results of the crash investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and all necessary steps will be taken without hesitation, Kinjarapu said.\nInvestigators on Friday recovered the plane’s digital flight data recorder, or the black box, which was recovered from a rooftop near the crash site and likely will lead to clues about the cause of the accident.\nIndia’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said it had started working with “full force” to extract the data.\nThe device is expected to reveal information about the engine and control settings, while the voice recorder will provide cockpit conversations, said Paul Fromme, a mechanical engineer with the U.K.-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\nAviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, a former crash investigator for both the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, said investigators should be able to answer some important questions about what caused the crash as soon as next week as long as the flight data recorder is in good shape.\nInvestigators likely are looking at whether wing flaps were set correctly, the engine lost power, alarms were going off inside the cockpit and if the plane’s crew correctly logged information about the hot temperature outside and the weight of the fuel and passengers, Guzzetti said.\nMistakes in the data could result in the wing flaps being set incorrectly, he said.\nThursday’s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.\nThere are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts.",

The death toll includes medical students who were in a college hostel when the plane hit the building shortly after takeoff, said Vidhi Chaudhary, a top state police officer in the northwestern city. “Most of the bodies have been charred beyond recognition,” she said. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah confirmed that a single passenger survived the crash and said he met him at the hospital. A doctor said he had examined the survivor, whom he identified as Vishwashkumar Ramesh. “He was disoriented with multiple injuries all over his body,” Dr. Dhaval Gameti told The Associated Press. “But he seems to be out of danger.” Black smoke billowed from the site where the plane crashed and burst into flames near the airport in Ahmedabad, a city of more than 5 million and the capital of Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state. Rescue team members work as smoke rises at the site where an Air India plane crashed June 12 in Ahmedabad, India.

Charred bodies lay on the ground and parts of the fuselage were scattered around the site. Indian army teams were assisting civil authorities to clear debris and help treat the injured. A video on social media showed the jet slowly descending as if it were landing. As soon as it disappeared out of view behind rows of houses, a giant fireball filled the sky. The AP was able to verify the video by matching up the flight path of the plane from the runway with the crash site and the nearby residential area. At the crash site, the tail cone of the aircraft with damaged stabilizer fins still attached to it was lodged near the top of one of the buildings. In a social media post, Modi called the crash “heartbreaking beyond words” and said “my thoughts are with everyone affected.” Sambit Patra, a lawmaker from Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, said Gujarat’s former chief minister, Vijay Rupani, was among the dead. Divyansh Singh, vice president of the Federation of All India Medical Association, said at least five students from the medical college were killed on the ground and 50 others were injured. Singh said some of them were in critical condition and many people are “feared buried in the debris.” Air India said the flight bound for London Gatwick Airport was carrying 242 passengers and crew, with 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian aboard.

Boeing said it was “working to gather more information.” India’s aviation regulatory body said the aircraft gave a mayday call, signaling an emergency, but then did not respond to the calls made by the airport traffic control. Aviation consultant John M. Cox, the CEO of Safety Operating Systems, told the AP from Los Angeles that while the first images of the crash were poor, it appeared the aircraft had its nose up and was not climbing, which is one of the things that investigators would look at. “At this point, it’s very, very, very early; we don’t know a whole lot,” he said. “But the 787 has very extensive flight data monitoring — the parameters on the flight data recorder are in the thousands — so once we get that recorder, they’ll be able to know pretty quickly what happened.” The wide-body, twin-engine aircraft was introduced in 2009, and more than 1,000 have been delivered to dozens of airlines, according to the flightradar24 website.

            "How critical minerals give China an edge in trade negotiations with U.S.. By — Simina Mistreanu, Associated Press Simina Mistreanu, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-critical-minerals-give-china-an-edge-in-trade-negotiations-with-u-s Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter How critical minerals give China an edge in trade negotiations with U.S. World Jun 12, 2025 2:27 PM EDT GANZHOU, China (AP) — China’s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal. China has spent decades building the world’s main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care. Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China’s control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them. Critical minerals as a trade issue Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world’s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses. But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a “certain number” of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump’s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia. Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources. “I think what the Chinese have proven is they have now created an entire export control regime for rare earths,” said Daniel Kritenbrink, a partner at The Asia Group consultancy. “They can turn that spigot on and off at will.” The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government’s earlier stance. “Without that,” he said, “it will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.” An industry built over decades with government support In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China’s ascent as the world’s biggest manufacturing power, famously said “the Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,” signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals. Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth’s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China’s economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a “vital strategic resource.” China today has an essential monopoly over “heavy rare earths,” used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles. READ MORE: Trump says U.S. will get rare earth minerals from China and tariffs on Chinese goods will total 55% under new trade framework The country also produces around 80% of the world’s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world’s germanium -– all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies. The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials. Beijing’s across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers. Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company’s work on humanoid robots. China’s critical minerals resources are dwindling In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains’ once-abundant resources. Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he’s unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry. “I find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,” he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors. At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.

Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand. Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank. The U.S. lags far behind China on critical minerals Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China. Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say. The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine’s owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed. Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It’s seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths. The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China’s could take decades. “There are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we’re developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,” Smith said. The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered “niche” because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “For many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,” McBride said. “And all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.” Associated Press news researcher Shihuan Chen contributed to this story.

Give Now By — Simina Mistreanu, Associated Press Simina Mistreanu, Associated Press\nGANZHOU, China (AP) — China’s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal. China has spent decades building the world’s main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care. Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China’s control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them. Critical minerals as a trade issue Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world’s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses. But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a “certain number” of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump’s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia. Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources. “I think what the Chinese have proven is they have now created an entire export control regime for rare earths,” said Daniel Kritenbrink, a partner at The Asia Group consultancy. “They can turn that spigot on and off at will.” The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government’s earlier stance. “Without that,” he said, “it will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.” An industry built over decades with government support In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China’s ascent as the world’s biggest manufacturing power, famously said “the Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,” signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals. Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth’s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China’s economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a “vital strategic resource.” China today has an essential monopoly over “heavy rare earths,” used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.

The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials. Beijing’s across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers. Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers.

China’s critical minerals resources are dwindling In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor.

In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses. Trump’s comment on social media came after two days of high-level U.S.-China trade talks in London. Details remain scarce. Trump didn’t fully spell out what concessions the U.S. made. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it. What Trump described as a “deal’’ is actually less than that: It’s a “framework’’ meant to set the stage for more substantive talks. And Trump’s own comments created confusion about what was happening to his taxes – tariffs — on Chinese imports, generating uncertainty about more than $660 billion in annual trade between the two countries. READ MORE: China says U.S. violating tariffs truce with moves on AI chips and student visas On social media, Trump declared: “WE ARE GETTING A TOTAL OF 55% TARIFFS, CHINA IS GETTING 10%. RELATIONSHIP IS EXCELLENT!” But a White House official, who was not authorized to discuss the terms publicly and insisted on anonymity to describe them, said the 55% was not an increase on the previous 30% tariff on China because Trump was including pre-existing tariffs, including some left over from his first term. “We have no idea what the rules are,″ said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of the educational toy company Learning Resources, who is part of a lawsuit challenging Trump’s authority to impose the tariffs. In a follow-up social media post, Trump said he and Xi “are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade. This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!” The framework emerged late Tuesday in London after intense talks involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer. Leading the Chinese delegation was Vice Premier He Lifeng. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has deployed tariffs aggressively, seeing them as a way to raise money for the federal government, protect American industries, lure factories back to the United States and pressure other countries into bending to his will. He has imposed baseline 10% tariffs on imports from almost every country on earth after having introduced and then suspended for 90 days bigger tariffs on countries based on the size of U.S. trade deficits last year. To American trading partners and to businesses calculating their import tax bills, the president’s mercurial approach to trade policy can be baffling. For example, he recently doubled his steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, likely increasing costs for U.S. manufacturers and construction companies that rely on the metals as raw materials. Likewise, he threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union under the belief that it would jumpstart talks with the bloc, only to back down as his self-imposed 90-day negotiating period is set to expire around July 9. But his approach to China has been especially bewildering. After imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese imports, the American president quickly upped the ante, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China’s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he increased those levies to a staggering 145%. Beijing counterpunched with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China, causing a hair-raising selloff in financial markets. At a meeting in Geneva last month, the two countries agreed to back off: America’s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China’s to 10%. In April, the Chinese announced licensing requirements that slowed the supply of desperately needed rare earth minerals to the United States. Furious about the move, Trump threatened to call off the Geneva arrangement, setting the stage for talks Monday and Tuesday in London. And there the Chinese agreed to speed up the rare earths shipments. The agreement came as an international rights group said that several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from the far-western Xinjiang region of China. The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.

China's exports jump 5.8% in June as tariffs reprieve prompts a rush of orders\nChina has reported its exports accelerated in June as a reprieve on U.S. tariffs prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers\nBANGKOK -- China’s exports accelerated in June as a reprieve on U.S. tariffs prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers ahead of an August deadline.\nExports climbed 5.8% from a year earlier, up from a 4.8% rise in May. Imports also recovered, growing 1.1% in the first increase so far this year, according to customs data released Monday.\nExports to the United States fell 16%, but that was less than half the 34.5% drop seen in May.\nAfter U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of up to 245% on imports from China and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, the two sides agreed to a truce to allow time for talks.\nThe retailers and other importers that had largely halted shipments of shoes, clothes, toys, and other items due to new tariffs then resumed imports from China.\nBut preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress and sudden changes in policy have raised uncertainty for companies trying to plan ahead.\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now.\nThe recovery in trade is expected to help boost economic growth in the April to June quarter. The Chinese government is due to report those figures on Tuesday.\nStill, the outlook is less upbeat, noted Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, noting that “tariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices.\n“We therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,” Huang said in a report.\nData for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump's return to the White House, China's global trade kept growing.\nTotal trade including exports and imports hit a record of more than 20 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) as Chinese businesses diversified their overseas production and export markets. China's global trade surplus in the first half of the year hit $586 billion.\nExports to Southeast Asia grew 13% year-on-year in January to June, with shipments to Thailand up 22%, to Vietnam up nearly 20% and to India up more than 18%.\nTrade with Europe also was brisk, climbing 6.6% in the first half of the year from a year earlier.\nBut auto exports fell after the European Union imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, sinking nearly 38% from a year earlier. Exports of auto parts fell more than 23%.\n___\nAP researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nA military exercise drawing together 19 nations and 35,000 forces begins in Australia\nJul 13, 10:28 PM\n-\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

READ MORE: 2 people recaptured after escaping New Jersey immigration detention center A reporter with The Associated Press witnessed Lander’s arrest at a federal building in Manhattan. The person Lander was walking out of the courtroom was also arrested. Lander had spent the morning observing immigration court hearings and told an AP reporter that he was there to “accompany” some immigrants out of the building. In the moments before Lander was handcuffed, agents could be seen trying to physically separate Lander from the man they had come to detain. Lander briefly struggled to stay close to the detainee before he was pulled away. Video taken by journalists at the scene shows that agents struggled to separate Lander from the man he’d linked arms with for more than 40 seconds before wresting the two apart. A video of the arrest captured by an AP reporter shows an agent telling Lander, “You’re obstructing.” “I’m not obstructing, I’m standing right here in the hallway,” Lander said as he was being handcuffed. “You don’t have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens asking for a judicial warrant,” Lander said as he was led away down a hallway and into an elevator. One of the officers who led Lander away wore a tactical vest labeled “federal agent.” Others were in plainclothes, with surgical masks over their faces. At a press conference following the arrest, Lander’s wife, Meg Barnette, said “we were swarmed by a number of federal agents” after her husband linked arms with the man following his immigration court hearing. “What I saw was shocking and unacceptable,” she said. “What I saw today was not the rule of law.” The episode occurred as federal immigration officials are conducting large-scale arrests outside immigration courtrooms across the country. In many cases, immigrants are arrested after a judge grants a government request to dismiss their case, making them eligible for expedited removal. “They remove any opportunity for due process,” Lander had told reporters earlier in the day after witnessing another person’s hearing. Lander’s detainment comes a little more than a month after Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge outside a federal immigration detention center in his city. The charge was later dropped by interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, and Baraka’s fellow Democrat, Rep. LaMonica McIver, was charged with assaulting and impeding federal agents stemming from her role at the same visit as the mayor. A federal indictment charges she grabbed, pushed and blocked officers from arresting the mayor. She’s denied the charges and said she plans to fight them. Baraka filed a federal lawsuit against Habba alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution. A spokesperson for the FBI deferred comment to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to an emailed inquiry. Lander is a candidate in the city’s Democratic mayoral primary. Early voting in the contest is underway and the election is next week. Candidates in the race quickly weighed in to criticize the arrest. “This is the latest example of the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control — one can only imagine the fear families across our country feel when confronted with ICE,” said former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running in the primary. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

A federal indictment charges she grabbed, pushed and blocked officers from arresting the mayor. She’s denied the charges and said she plans to fight them. Baraka filed a federal lawsuit against Habba alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution. A spokesperson for the FBI deferred comment to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to an emailed inquiry. Lander is a candidate in the city’s Democratic mayoral primary. Early voting in the contest is underway and the election is next week. Candidates in the race quickly weighed in to criticize the arrest. “This is the latest example of the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control — one can only imagine the fear families across our country feel when confronted with ICE,” said former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running in the primary. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times. Give Now",

            "Padilla forcibly removed from Noem press conference, handcuffed. Padilla forcibly removed from Noem press conference, handcuffed\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was forcibly removed and then handcuffed after he interrupted a press conference Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held in Los Angeles.\nVideo of the incident shared by a Fox News reporter shows multiple men restraining Padilla and forcing him out of the room, while other videos show they later pushed him to the floor to handcuff him.\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla is heard saying as multiple people push him out of the room.\nAs he is thrown out two double doors he can be heard saying,” Hands off!”\nThe press conference kicked off with Padilla swiftly interrupting Noem only to be confronted by what appear to be her security detail.\nLater during the press conference, Noem said she would plan to speak with the senator.\nPadilla’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Noem said she planned to speak with him.\n“When I leave here I’ll have a conversation with him, but I think everyone would agree that wasn’t appropriate,” she said during the press conference.\n“When I leave here I’ll find him and visit and find out really what his concerns were. I think everybody in America would agree that that wasn’t appropriate, that if you wanted to have a civil discussion, especially as a leader, a public official, that you would reach out and try to have a conversation,” she said.\n“For instance, I have left voicemails for [California] Gov. [Gavin] Newsom wanting to have a conversation. Has he returned them? No, he hasn’t.”\nA statement from Padilla’s office said he is not currently detained but offered few other details about what transpired after he was handcuffed.\n“Senator Padilla is currently in Los Angeles exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government’s operations in Los Angeles and across California. He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem’s press conference. He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed. He is not currently detained, and we are working to get additional information,” his office said.\nPadilla later spoke out about the incident, characterizing it as an attack on his First Amendment rights and efforts to represent his constituents.\n“I will say this: If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, I can only imagine what they’re doing to farm workers to cooks to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country,” he said.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later accused Padilla of failing to identify himself and “lunging” toward Noem.\nWhile Padilla did push his way toward the front of the room, he clearly identifies himself.\n“Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theatre and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote on social platform X.\n“Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands. @SecretService thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.”\nPadilla’s push to question Noem comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have conducted widespread raids across Los Angeles, prompting protests and later some riots in the city.\nPresident Trump has since called in both the National Guard and the Marines to protect ICE officers carrying out their duties.\nNoem’s press conference was originally designed to boast of the results of the operation.\n“People should know that there are millions of people that are in the city illegally, and that we have, I would say thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of targets that we’ll be going after,” Noem said.\nThe matter earned immediate condemnation from Democratic colleagues.\n“Watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote on X.\n“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”\nUpdated at 4:32 p.m. EDT\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

            "Padilla blasts Trump ‘path toward fascism’ in Los Angeles immigration crackdown. 16:02\nrepublished\nPadilla blasts Trump ‘path toward fascism’ in Los Angeles immigration crackdown\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, speaks on the Senate floor on June 17, 2025, about how he was forcibly removed from a press conference with the secretary of Homeland Security. (Screenshot from Senate webcast)\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a press conference with the secretary of Homeland Security, said Tuesday that his home state is the testing ground for President Donald Trump’s push to deploy the military within the United States.\nTrump is using immigrants in the country without legal status as scapegoats to send in troops, said Padilla, who in a speech on the Senate floor choked up as he related how he was wrestled to the ground by law enforcement officials. “I refuse to let immigrants be political pawns on his path toward fascism,” Padilla said.\nIt’s the first floor speech the senior senator from California has given since the highly publicized incident in Los Angeles last week. The Secret Service handcuffed Padilla after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was defending to reporters Trump’s decision to send 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to LA.\nTrump sent in the troops following multi-day protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and against California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes. An appeals court Tuesday is hearing arguments on a suit by California contending that the president unlawfully took control of the state National Guard.\n“He wants the spectacle,” Padilla said of the president. “To justify his undemocratic crackdown and his authoritarian power grab.”\nThe LA protests were sparked after ICE targeted Home Depots, places where undocumented day laborers typically search for work, for immigration raids.\nArrests, confrontations\nThe Padilla incident, widely captured on video, was a stark escalation of the tensions between Democratic lawmakers and the administration over Trump’s drive to enact mass deportations.\nA Democratic House member from New Jersey is facing federal charges on allegations that she shoved immigration officials while protesting the opening of an immigrant detention center in Newark. And on Tuesday, in New York City, ICE officers arrested city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander while he was escorting an immigrant to their hearing in immigration court, according to The Associated Press.\nIn a statement to States Newsroom, DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.”\n“No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,” McLaughlin said.\nThe president late Sunday directed ICE to conduct immigration raids in New York, LA and Chicago, the nation’s three most populous cities, all led by elected Democrats in heavily Democratic states.\n“We will follow the President’s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America’s streets,” McLaughlin said.\n‘They opened the door for me’\nPadilla in his Senate remarks gave an account of the events that led to him being handcuffed and detained last week.\nOn June 12, he had a meeting scheduled with General Gregory M. Guillot, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, to discuss the military presence in LA.\nPadilla, the top Democrat on a Judiciary panel that oversees DHS and immigration policy, said his meeting with the general was delayed because of a press briefing across the hall with Noem.\nPadilla said he has tried to speak with DHS because for weeks LA has “seen a disturbing pattern of increasingly extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations targeting non-violent people at places of worship, at schools, in courthouses.”\nSo Padilla said he asked to attend the press conference, and a National Guard member and an FBI agent escorted him inside.\n“They opened the door for me,” he said.\nAs he listened, he said a comment from Noem compelled him to ask a question.\n“We are not going away,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, told the press. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”\nPadilla said her remarks struck him as “an un-American mission statement.”\n“That cannot be the mission of federal law enforcement and the United States military,” he said. “Are we truly prepared to live in a country where the president can deploy the armed forces to decide which duly elected governors and mayors should be allowed to lead their constituents?”\nPadilla said before he could finish his question, he was physically removed and the National Guard member and FBI agent who escorted him in the room “stood by silently, knowing full well who I was.”\nAs he recounted being handcuffed, Padilla paused, getting emotional.\n“I was forced to the ground, first on my knees, and then flat on my chest,” he said.\nPadilla said a flurry of questions went through his head as he was marched down a hallway, and as he kept asking why he was being detained: Where are they taking me? What will a city, already on the edge from being militarized, think when they see their U.S. senator being handcuffed just for trying to ask a question? What will my wife think? What will our boys think?\n“I also remember asking myself, if this aggressive escalation is the result of someone speaking up about the abuse and overreach of the Trump administration, was it really worth it?” Padilla asked. “If a United States senator becomes too afraid to speak up, how can we expect any other American to do the same?”\nPadilla-Noem meeting\nIn a statement, DHS, said that the Secret Service did not know Padilla was a U.S. senator, although video of the incident shows that Padilla stated that he was a member of the Senate.\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,” he said as four federal law enforcement officers grabbed him and shoved him to the ground.\nNoem met with Padilla after he was handcuffed, his office told States Newsroom.\n“He raised concerns with the deployment of military forces and the needless escalation over the last week, among other issues,” according to his office. “And he voiced his frustration with the continued lack of response from this administration. It was a civil, brief meeting, but the Secretary did not provide any meaningful answers. The Senator was simply trying to do his job and seek answers for the people he represents in California.”\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested that the Senate take action against Padilla, such as a censure. Johnson criticized the senator’s actions and accused him of charging at Noem, which Padilla is not seen doing in the multiple videos of the incident.\n“I’m not in that chamber, but I do think that it merits immediate attention by other colleagues over there,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I think that behavior, at a minimum, rises to the level of censure. I think there needs to be a message sent by the body as a whole.”\nSenate Democrats have coalesced their support around Padilla. During a Tuesday press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Padilla for his speech on the Senate floor.\n“It was basically a strong plea for America to regain the gyroscope of democracy, which has led us forward for so many years and now we’re losing it,” the New York Democrat said. “It’s a wake-up call to all Americans.”\nJennifer Shutt contributed to this report.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "Sen. Alex Padilla is forcibly removed from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference in Los Angeles. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcibly removed from a news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday after trying to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference related to immigration.\n\"I am Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,\" Padilla said to Noem, which prompted several men to physically push him out of the room. It was unclear who the men were, as several were dressed in plain clothes.\nPadilla's office shared a video of the incident with NBC News. The video shows Padilla being taken into a hallway outside and pushed face forward onto the ground as officers with FBI-identifying vests told the senator to put his hands behind his back. The officers then handcuffed him.\nPresident Donald Trump's immigration policies — and the administration's handling of demonstrations against those policies — have sparked an outcry in recent days. After protesters clashed with officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Friday, the president deployed members of the National Guard, and later Marines, to assist local law enforcement. Dozens of demonstrations have taken place across the country in the days that followed.\nSpeaking to reporters later Thursday, Padilla said he was receiving a briefing from military officials when he learned Noem was in the same building and decided to join her briefing.\n\"I was there peacefully,\" he said. \"At one point, I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room, I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed.\"\nHe added, \"If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.”\nDHS responded on X, falsely claiming that Padilla \"interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself.\" Noem made the same false allegation during an interview on Fox News.\n\"Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,\" DHS said, claiming that agents \"thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.\"\nBefore Padilla began questioning Noem, she spoke to reporters about the administration's actions, the subject of her appearance in Los Angeles. Noem said that DHS and its agencies, as well as the military, \"will continue to sustain and increase our operations in this city,\" she said.\n\"We are not going away,\" she said. \"We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country,\" she said, referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats.\nAs Padilla tried to question her, Noem spoke over the senator, \"I want to say thank you to every single person,\" and he was removed from the room.\nThe incident provoked further outrage from Democrats.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced the incident on the Senate floor. \"I just saw something that sickened my stomach — the manhandling of a United States senator. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,\" he said.\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the state's other senator, wrote on X that Padilla \"represents the best of the Senate. The disgraceful and disrespectful conduct of DHS agents, pushing and shoving him out of a briefing like that, demands our condemnation. He will not be silenced or intimidated. His questions will be answered. I’m with Alex.\"\nNewsom said in a post on X that Padilla \"is one of the most decent people I know.\" \"This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now,\" he added.\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris called the incident \"a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, criticized Padilla over the episode.\n\"Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt.\"\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that what his Democratic colleague \"ought to be doing, in my view, is making sure that we have rational immigration policy. And Sen. Padilla, who’s a nice man, sat on the sidelines for four years, watch the border completely be blown apart.”\nThe incident follows a string of arrests of Democratic elected officials related to immigration. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested last month for allegedly trespassing at an ICE facility in New Jersey. The charges were ultimately dropped, but he has sued interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba over the incident and Ricky J. Patel, a special agent in charge of the Newark division of Homeland Security Investigations.\nEarlier this week, Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was indicted on federal charges that stemmed from the same confrontation with law enforcement.\nTrump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan also suggested that Newsom and Bass could be arrested, too, if they interfere with federal agents."

            "Trump's EPA delivers new blow to Biden climate agenda. Trump’s EPA delivers new blow to Biden climate agenda\nEPA argues that the second-largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution contributes too little to the world’s climate problem to be worth regulating.\nThe Trump administration announced Wednesday that it’s revoking limits on power plants’ climate pollution — removing the cornerstone of a decadelong strategy to douse one of the nation’s largest sources of heat-trapping gases.\nThe proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency would free thousands of existing and future facilities that burn coal or natural gas from regulations aimed at lowering their output of carbon dioxide pollution. It comes as President Donald Trump has shuttered climate change offices across the government, fired scientists and frozen billions of dollars in funding for renewable energy projects.\nEPA’s plan to unshackle the power sector — the second-largest source of U.S. climate pollution, behind transportation — collides with the agency’s past assertions that the most effective way to slow rising temperatures is by tackling the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases.\nAdministrator Lee Zeldin has reversed that argument. His proposed repeal of President Joe Biden’s 2024 power plant climate rule asserts that the electricity-generating facilities contribute too little climate pollution globally to warrant being regulated. That’s even though the United States is the world’s second-largest climate polluter, ranking only behind China. The U.S. power sector releases more carbon emissions than all but five countries.\nEPA’s new rule said that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. fossil fuel power plants are not significant because they “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions; cost-effective control measures are not reasonably available; and because this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”\nPower plants are responsible for almost a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, or about 2.7 percent of all global climate pollution, according to EPA. The agency argued in its proposed rollback that the facilities’ don’t contribute “significantly” to global warming, using language from a legal threshold for regulation in the Clean Air Act.\nThe assertion promises to ignite court challenges from green groups and Democratic-led states.\n“The collision between Republican political imperatives driven by the fossil fuel industry and fact and reality is particularly apparent in this because power plant emissions in the United States are a very significant part of global emissions,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “So it’s just plain false to pretend this isn’t a big deal.”\nIf the courts uphold the EPA rule, which the administration expects to finalize this year, it could free the government from legal requirements to regulate climate emissions from other stationary sources such as refineries and industrial facilities.\nThe administration also announced it will roll back (Reg. 2060-AW68) a separate Biden-era rule aimed at reducing power plants’ releases of toxic mercury into the air (Reg. 2060-AV53), strengthening the original Obama-era standards.\nEPA’s plan also targets a 2015 rule requiring new coal plants to capture a share of their carbon emissions. The Obama-era standard remained on the books throughout the first Trump administration — largely because no new coal-fired power plants were planned.\nThe rollback comes as EPA targets the scientific underpinning for its authority to limit climate pollution — not just from power plants, but also the transportation sector, the largest U.S. source of warming gases. Called the endangerment finding, the landmark 2009 conclusion found that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health.\nEPA is expected to announce later this year whether it plans to repeal that finding, a step that could allow the Trump administration to stop regulating climate pollution from cars and trucks. Together, those vehicles are responsible for about 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions or around 3.4 percent globally.\nTo regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to determine that such pollution “causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”\nIn the final days of Trump’s first term in January 2021, EPA issued a surprise rule defining the significance threshold at 3 percent of U.S. emissions. Such a level would have maintained regulation over power plants but exempted every other industry, including oil and gas production, oil refining and industrial boilers used in a variety of manufacturing sectors.\nThe rule was later vacated in court because the Trump administration had issued it as a final rule without going through the required public rulemaking process.\nThis time, EPA is going even further by effectively saying that no industry in the U.S. contributes “significantly” to climate change, and thus the agency has no authority to regulate (Reg. 2060-AW55).\nYet the U.S. has contributed one-fifth of the pollution that has driven climate change to date and remains the world’s second-largest source of planet-heating gases.\nThat means greenhouse gases from any U.S. sector intensify warming, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate science professor at Stanford University. The science shows that each increment of warming from those emissions causes a “multiple, exponential effect” in terms of the impacts to the planet, he said.\nThat brings severe economic costs. Diffenbaugh’s research group found that over a nearly 30-year period, heavier precipitation linked to climate change resulted in 36 percent of U.S. financial losses from flooding, while hotter temperatures caused about 20 percent of insured crop losses. Damages amounted to tens of billions of dollars.\n“We can absolutely expect the stresses that we experience from the climate system to accelerate,” he said. “How much of that we experience really does depend on how much humans emit going forward in the future.”\nThe agency is also proposing to repeal the Biden administration’s power plant climate rule (Reg. 2060-AV09). That regulation effectively required coal-fired power plants planning to operate long-term to install technology to capture most of their carbon emissions — something no coal plant in the U.S. has ever done on that scale. It also required some new gas-fired power plants to eventually install carbon capture systems.\nIndustry groups have argued that using carbon capture systems as the rule’s benchmark technology was impractical and possibly illegal.\nDuring oral arguments over the rule in December, several federal appellate judges questioned whether carbon capture technology was ready for the kind of wide-scale deployment EPA’s rule would require — even if the agency expected most power plants would choose to shut down rather than invest significant sums in pollution controls. The court never decided whether Biden’s rule was lawful.\nThe 2024 rule would also have required coal plants that commit to closing by 2039 to reduce emissions by co-firing with gas — a requirement the Trump administration proposed to strike down because it says it violates a Supreme Court prohibition on fuel shifting.\nThe Biden rule was EPA’s third effort to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants.\nIn 2015, the Obama administration issued the Clean Power Plan, which relied heavily on utilities shifting away from coal and toward natural gas and renewables to reduce climate pollution across the electricity sector. The Supreme Court later ruled that the plan overstepped the agency’s authority, which the justices said is limited to addressing pollution from specific sources as opposed to entire industries.\nDuring Trump’s first term, EPA issued a rule requiring only minor efficiency upgrades to coal plants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck that down because EPA had refused to consider other methods of emissions reductions.\nDespite EPA spinning its wheels on tackling power plant climate pollution for more than a decade, the sector has reduced its emissions anyway — by about 41 percent from its peak in 2007, according to EPA data.\nThe decrease was caused by a long-term shift away from coal as market forces and the risk of EPA eventually imposing climate rules pushed the sector to use more natural gas and renewable energy.\nZack Colman, Annie Snider and Josh Siegel contributed to this report.",
            "‘We've lost the culture war on climate’. ‘We’ve lost the culture war on climate’\nThe U.S. government has long recognized greenhouse gases as a threat, but major rules to address them have failed to stick.\nPresident Donald Trump’s latest climate rollback makes it all but official: The United States is giving up on trying to stop the planet’s warming.\nIn some ways, the effort has barely started.\nMore than 15 years after federal regulators officially recognized that greenhouse gas pollution threatens “current and future generations,” their most ambitious efforts to defuse that threat have been blocked in the courts and by Trump’s rule-slicing buzzsaw. Wednesday’s action by the Environmental Protection Agency would extend that streak by wiping out a Biden-era regulation on power plants — leaving the nation’s second-largest source of climate pollution unshackled until at least the early 2030s. Rules aimed at lessening climate pollution from transportation, the nation’s No. 1 source, are also on the Trump hit list.\nMeanwhile, the GOP megabill lumbering through the Senate would dismember former President Joe Biden’s other huge climate initiative, the 2022 law that sought to use hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to encourage consumers and businesses to switch to carbon-free energy. At the same time, Trump’s appointees have spent months shutting down climate programs, firing their workers and gutting research into the problem, while making it harder for states such as California to tackle the issue on their own.\nThe years of whipsawing moves have left Washington with no consistent approach on how — or whether — to confront climate change, even as scientists warn that years are growing short to avoid catastrophic damage to human society. While the Trump-era GOP’s hardening opposition to climate action has been a major reason for the lack of consensus, one former Democratic adviser said her own party needs to find a message that resonates with broad swaths of the electorate.\n“There’s no way around it: The left strategy on climate needs to be rethought,” said Jody Freeman, who served as counselor for energy and climate change in President Barack Obama’s White House. “We’ve lost the culture war on climate, and we have to figure out a way for it to not be a niche leftist movement.”\nIt’s a strategy Freeman admitted she was “struggling” to articulate, but one that included using natural gas as a “bridge fuel” to more renewable power — an approach Democrats embraced during the Obama administration — finding “a new approach” for easing permits for energy infrastructure and building broad-based political support.\nAs the Democratic nominee in 2008, Obama expressed the hope that his campaign would be seen as “the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” But two years later, the Democrats’ cap-and-trade climate bill failed to get through a Senate where they held a supermajority. Obama didn’t return to the issue in earnest until his second term, taking actions including the enactment of a sweeping power plant rule that wasn’t yet in effect when Trump rescinded it and the Supreme Court declared it dead.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have moved far from their seemingly moderating stance in 2008, when nominee John McCain offered his own climate proposals and even then-President George W. Bush announced a modest target for slowing carbon pollution by 2025.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin contended Wednesday that the Obama- and Biden-era rules were overbearing and too costly.\n“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November: They wanted to make sure that all agencies were cognizant of their economic concerns,” he said when announcing the rule rollback at agency headquarters. “At the EPA under President Trump, we have chosen to both protect the environment and grow the economy.”\nTrump’s new strategy of ditching greenhouse gas limits altogether is legally questionable, experts involved in crafting the Obama and Biden power plant rules told POLITICO. But they acknowledged that the Trump administration at the very least will significantly weaken rules on power plants’ climate pollution, at a moment when the trends are going in the wrong direction.\nGina McCarthy, who led EPA during the Obama administration, said in a statement that Zeldin’s rationale is “absolutely illogical and indefensible. It’s a purely political play that goes against decades of science and policy review.”\nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions were virtually flat last year, falling just 0.2 percent, after declining 20 percent since 2005, according to the research firm Rhodium Group. That output would need to fall 7.6 percent annually through 2030 to meet the climate goals Biden floated, which were aimed at limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That level is a critical threshold for avoiding the most severe impacts of climate change.\nThose targets now look out of reach. The World Meteorological Organization last month gave 70 percent odds that the five-year global temperature average through 2029 would register above 1.5 degrees.\nThe Obama-era rule came out during a decade when governments around the world threw their weight behind blunting climate pollution through executive actions. Ricky Revesz, who was Biden’s regulatory czar, recalled the “great excitement” at the White House Blue Room reception just before Obama announced his power plant rule, known as the Clean Power Plan. It seemed a watershed moment. But it didn’t last.\n“I thought that it was going to be a more linear path forward,” he said. “That linear path forward has not materialized. And that is disappointing.”\nOpponents who have long argued that such regulations would wreck the economy while doing little to curb global temperature increases have traveled the same road in reverse. Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he felt dread when Obama announced the Clean Power Plan in 2015. Then the state’s attorney general, he feared the rule’s focus on curbing carbon dioxide from power plants would have a “catastrophic” impact on West Virginia’s coal-reliant economy.\n“It was really an audacious and outrageous attempt to regulate the economy when they had no power to do so,” said Morrisey, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA over Obama’s proposal. “You can’t take the actions that they were trying to take without going to the legislature.”\nMeanwhile, Congress has become harsher terrain for climate action.\nIn May, House Republicans voted to undo the incentives for electric cars and other clean energy technologies in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the nation’s most significant effort to spur clean energy and curb climate change.\nThat same week, 35 House Democrats and Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) crossed the aisle and voted to kill an EPA waiver that had allowed California to set more stringent tailpipe pollution standards for vehicles to deal with its historically smoggy skies. California was planning to use that waiver to end sales of internal combustion engine vehicles in 2035, a rule 10 other states and the District of Columbia had planned to follow.\nThe Supreme Court has added to the obstacles for climate policy — introducing more existential challenges for efforts to use executive powers to corral greenhouse gas emissions. In its 2022 decision striking down the Obama administration’s power plant rule, the court said agencies such as EPA need Congress’ explicit approval before enacting regulations that would have a “major” impact on the economy. (It didn’t precisely define what counts as “major.”) In 2024, the court eviscerated a decades-old precedent known as the Chevron doctrine, which had afforded agencies broad leeway in how they interpret vague statutes.\nMany climate advocates and former Democratic officials contend that all those obstacles are bumps, not barriers, on the tortuous path to reducing greenhouse gases. They say that even the regulatory fits and starts have provided signals to markets and businesses about where federal policy is heading in the long term — prodding the private sector to make investments to green the nation’s energy system.\nOne symptom is a sharp decline in U.S. reliance on coal — by far the most climate-polluting power source, and the one that would face the stiffest restrictions in any successful federal regulation to lessen the electricity industry’s emissions. Coal supplied 48.5 percent of the nation’s power generation in 2007, but that fell to 15 percent in 2024. Last year, solar and wind power combined to overtake coal for the first time.\n“Regulation has served the purpose of moving things along faster,” said Janet McCabe, who was deputy EPA administrator under Biden and ran EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation during Obama’s second term. “The trajectory is always in the right direction.”\nFreeman, who is now at Harvard Law School, said federal regulations plus state laws requiring renewable power to comprise portions of the electricity mix helped justify utility investments in clean energy. That, in turn, accelerated price drops for wind and solar power, she said.\nClean energy advocates point to those broader market shifts, calling a cleaner power grid inevitable.\n“There are people in each of these industries who wouldn’t have taken the climate problem seriously and cleaner technology seriously, and invested in it, if it weren’t for the pressure of the Clean Air Act and the incentives that more recently had been built into the IRA,” said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “So policy does matter, even when it’s not in a straight line and the implementation is inadequate.”\nBut even if those economic trends continue — an open question given the enormous new power demand from data centers — it will not bring the U.S. closer to cuts needed to keep the world from overheating, multiple climate studies have concluded. And the greatest chunk of the emissions decline since 2005 comes from shifting coal to natural gas, another fossil fuel, which fracking made cheap and abundant.\nBiden’s power plant rule, now being shelved by Trump’s EPA, would have imposed limits on both coal-burning power plants and future gas-fired ones, requiring them to either capture their greenhouse gases or shut down.\nStaving off regulations may well keep coal-fired power plants running longer than anticipated to meet forecast demand growth, belching more carbon dioxide into the air. The Trump administration has even sought to temporarily exempt power plants from air pollution rules altogether and is trying to use emergency powers to prevent coal generators from shuttering.\nWithout federal rules that say otherwise, power providers would also be likely to add more natural gas generation to the grid.\nFailing to curb power plants’ pollution, scientists say, means temperatures will continue to rise and bring more of the floods, heat waves, wildfires, supply chain disruptions, food shortages and other shocks that cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars each year in property damage, illness, death and lost productivity.\n“I don’t think the economics are going to take care of it by any means,” said Joe Goffman, who led the Biden EPA air office. “The effects of climate change are going to continue to be felt and they’re going to continue to be costly in terms of dollars and cents and in terms of human experience.”\nSome state governors, such as Democrats Kathy Hochul of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, have vowed to go it alone on climate policy if need be.\nBut analyses have shown state actions alone are unlikely to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions at the scale and speed needed to avoid baking in catastrophic effects from climate change.\nThe Sierra Club, for example, has helped shutter nearly 400 coal-fired units across the U.S. since 2010 through its Beyond Coal campaign, which has argued the economic case against fossil fuel generation in front of state utility commissions. While Joanne Spalding, the group’s legal director, said it can continue to strike blows against coal with that strategy, she acknowledged that “gas is a huge problem” — and left no doubt that the Trump administration’s moves would do damage.\n“Given what the science says about the need to act urgently, this will be a lost four years in the United States,” she said.",
            "Trump's EPA wants to repeal regulations on carbon emissions from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will aim to eliminate existing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, a move that would curb the agency’s ability to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news conference that Biden-era carbon pollution standards for power plants “suffocate” the economy in order to protect the environment. Zeldin, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in January, stated that the agency’s announcement was a huge step forward in energy dominance for the U.S., while promising that no power plants would emit more than they already do. Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.\nZeldin also said the EPA plans to weaken Biden-era regulations on mercury emissions from power plants.\nEnvironmental advocates say the EPA’s proposal is an escalation in the Trump administration’s ongoing push against climate action across federal agencies, including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy and the National Weather Service. In 2024, the Biden administration finalized the most stringent carbon pollution standards for power plants to date in an effort to tackle the climate crisis — but now, those rules face an uncertain future.\nGina McCarthy, a former EPA Administrator under President Joe Biden, called Zeldin’s announcement a “political play” that defies “decades of science and policy review” in a statement on Wednesday.\n“By giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,” McCarthy said.\nJill Tauber, the vice president of litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice, a nonprofit currently suing the Trump administration over several environmental rollbacks said: “Eliminating pollution standards from the largest industrial source of greenhouse gas pollution in the United States flies in the face of what the law requires, what the science tells us, and what we’re seeing every day.”\nPower plants in the U.S. are a huge contributor to global carbon emissions. A report published by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law found that if the U.S. power sector were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world.\nUnder the first Trump administration, the EPA rolled back several Obama-era greenhouse gas standards on power plants, but this recent announcement marks the first time the agency has suggested outright repeals. Zeldin’s move on power plants follows his promise in March to tackle the “climate change religion” by reconsidering or repealing 31 regulations surrounding tailpipe emissions, coal ash regulations and oil and gas wastewater management.\nThe proposed rule, which will now move into its comment period, will face scrutiny from legal advocates and environmental nonprofits like Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which say the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by law — citing seminal cases like the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA lawsuit, which determined that greenhouse gases must be regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.\n“We’ll be watching closely to see if the EPA proceeds with repealing these life-saving standards based on a legal theory that doesn’t pass the laugh test,” said Meredith Hawkins, the federal climate legal director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The NRDC stands ready to defend the public’s right to breathe in court if needed.”\nCutting historic limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants would impact global climate change, but it could also cause ripple effects on human health and the economy.\nHarvey Reiter, an energy and utilities lawyer and a law professor at George Washington University, says that if the EPA moves forward with its planned repeals, he expects some energy companies and utilities that have retooled operations and made long-term investments in renewable energy to sue the Trump administration.\n“The biggest impacts of the proposed rules are uncertainty and instability,” he said. “Nobody knows what to do next. It makes investment decisions harder. It makes decisions about hiring, staff and employees harder. It creates a lot of uncertainty in the market.”\nGreenhouse gas emissions from power plants are not just a climate issue. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and fine particulate matter, which are linked to increased risk of respiratory issues and cardiovascular disease. Regulating carbon emissions from power plants broadly reduces other air pollution for communities living near power plants, said Laura Kate Bender, the vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.\n“It works both ways. On the one hand, power plants burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change and cause health problems at the same time,” said Bender. “And then climate change, in many cases, contributes to extreme heat, or more wildfire smoke, or more ozone smogs. Climate change is a health emergency, and cutting carbon in the power sector is a critical tool in the toolbox for fighting climate change.”"

The justices’ 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump’s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to the one in Tennessee. LISTEN: Supreme Court considers Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors The decision comes amid a range of other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration sued Maine for not complying with the government’s push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports. The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. In addition, the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court battles continue. The president also signed another order to define the sexes as only male and female. Trump’s administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths. The justices acted a month after the United Kingdom’s top court delivered a setback to transgender rights, ruling unanimously that the U.K. Equality Act means trans women can be excluded from some groups and single-sex spaces, such as changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women. Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. That decision is not affected by Wednesday’s ruling. But the justices on Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found that “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions. When the case was argued in December, then-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration and families of transgender adolescents had called on the high court to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans. They argued that the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Tennessee’s law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but it allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes. Soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department told the court that its position had changed. A major issue in the case was the appropriate level of scrutiny courts should apply to such laws. The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority. The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.

            "Supreme Court upholds Tennessee ban on transgender youth medical care. WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, delivering a major blow to transgender rights.\nThe 6-3 ruling is likely to have a broad impact as 24 other states have already enacted laws similar to the one in Tennessee, which bars gender transition surgery, puberty blockers and hormone therapy for youth.\nThose laws now look set to survive similar legal challenges. The ruling does not affect states that do not have such bans, meaning care in those states will still be available.\nThe court was divided on ideological lines, with the six conservatives in the majority and the three liberals in dissent.\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that the Tennessee law does not constitute a form of sex discrimination that would violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" Roberts wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.\"\n\"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements,\" he added.\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that contrary to the majority's conclusion, the law does discriminate based on both sex and transgender status and should therefore be analyzed closely.\n\"By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims,\" she wrote. \"In sadness, I dissent.\"\nSotomayor also took the relatively unusual step of reading a summary of her decision from the bench in court, saying the impact of the decision is \"incredibly dangerous.\"\nTrans rights activists have warned that a ruling allowing bans on care for trans minors could pave the way for similar restrictions aimed at adults.\n\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the challengers, said in a statement.\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti welcomed the decision as a win for \"common sense over judicial activism.\"\nHe added that legislators should give \"careful scrutiny\" before allowing such treatments, making judgments \"based on science, not ideology.\"\nThe legal challenge was brought by the administration of former President Joe Biden, as well as transgender teens and their families.\nThe ruling does not resolve all legal issues relating to the state bans, as it did not address a separate argument under the 14th Amendment that the laws violate the right of parents to make health care decisions for their children.\nThe court also did not rule on the question of whether laws that discriminate against transgender people are subject to what is called \"heightened scrutiny,\" meaning that judges should review them with a skeptical eye. But three of the conservative justices said transgender people are not a \"suspect class,\" meaning laws targeting them should not receive heightened scrutiny.\nOther issues involving transgender rights, such as laws blocking transgender girls from participating in sports, are likely to reach the court in due course.\nUpon taking office in January, President Donald Trump has set about unwinding Biden policies that sought to bolster transgender rights.

            "How the Senate's proposed Medicaid cuts could deepen the rural hospital crisis. Rural hospitals across the U.S. — many already hanging by a thread — could take a serious hit if a proposed Medicaid cut in the Senate’s domestic spending bill is signed into law.\nThe provision, outlined in the 549-page bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on Monday, would gradually limit states’ use of Medicaid’s so-called provider tax.\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.\nThe provider tax is a state-imposed fee on hospitals and other health care providers to help fund a state’s share of the Medicaid program. When states use provider funds to boost their Medicaid spending, the federal government gives them more money because it's required to match it.\nThe tax must apply to all providers within a class — so if a state wants to tax hospitals, it must include all licensed hospitals. Most states have multiple provider taxes, including taxes for nursing facilities and ambulance services, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy who focuses primarily on Medicaid.\nAll states, except for Alaska, have at least one provider tax, Park said. A good chunk of the money raised goes toward supporting rural hospitals, which often serve a higher share of low-income and Medicaid patients.\n“It’s a key financing source for rural hospitals, which tend to have much thinner operating margins,” Park said. In recent years, he added, rural hospitals have “had a rash of closures, staff cuts and service cuts” due to financial hardship.\nA report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a think tank, found that one-third of all rural hospitals are at risk of closing.\nThe Senate proposal would gradually reduce the provider’s tax rate of 6% or less to 3.5% by 2031, according to Monday’s outline. States that haven’t expanded Medicaid, such as Florida and Texas, would get to keep their rates at their current levels.\nTaxes on nursing homes and intermediate care facilities, which provide services for people with disabilities, are exempt from the new limit.\nDr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said the Senate’s proposal is more aggressive than the House’s version, which proposes freezing the provider tax rate at its current level and barring states from implementing new taxes.\nGaffney published a study on Monday that found the Medicaid cuts proposed in the House bill could cause an estimated 7.6 million Americans to lose health insurance, leading to thousands of preventable deaths.\nUnder the Senate’s proposal, Gaffney said rural hospitals will likely be forced to reduce the services they offer, cut staff or close altogether. Many more patients would also likely die, he added, because they no longer have a hospital nearby.\nA report from the Pew Research Center found rural Americans live an average of 10.5 miles or 17 minutes from the nearest hospital — about twice as far and five to seven minutes longer than people in suburban and urban areas.\n“There’s no way around it. It’s just basic math,” Gaffney said. “It means more harm, and that more people will die from lack of care.”\nGaffney said Republicans should be taking steps to keep hospitals in rural areas, where many of their voters live, open.\n“At the end of the day, hospitals that are in places where patients are poor tend to be poor and to be more at risk of closure,” he said.\nKevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital, a 25-bed rural hospital in Hugo, Colorado, said his business is unlikely to survive under the proposed changes.\nStansbury said his hospital serves an area roughly the size of Connecticut but has only about two providers per square mile. About 25% of his patients are on Medicaid.\nThe hospital receives about $300,000 a month in provider tax reimbursements, which he said are “essential for us to keep our doors open” and is still only enough to break even.\nWithout the 6% provider tax rate, he will likely have to start cutting services for patients, including long-term care, he said.\n“If I start crying, forgive me,” Stansbury said. “It just breaks my heart.”\nThe proposed cuts in the Senate bill are not final and may not end up in the version that reaches President Donald Trump’s desk.\nIf the Senate’s provider tax changes do make it through to the final bill, they are likely to be deeply unpopular among the public, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy.\nPolling shows that about 3 in 4 rural residents say funding for Medicaid should increase or stay the same, Rudowitz said. About three-quarters of people living in rural areas, she added, say that Medicaid is very important to people in their communities.\n“Changes that would restrict or retrench coverage gains could have negative implications for these hospitals,” she said.\nRural hospitals groups are already pushing back on the proposed limits on the provider tax.\nIn an emailed statement, Bruce Siegel, the president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, a nonprofit group that advocates for hospitals serving poor communities, said the Senate’s changes “would devastate health care access for millions of Americans and hollow out the vital role essential hospitals play in their communities.”\nIn a release Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the proposed cuts.\n“Senate Republicans would pay for those new corporate tax breaks by making even deeper cuts to Medicaid, slashing funding for rural hospitals and other essential health care providers and throwing cash-strapped states off a funding cliff,” Wyden said.",
            "Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” Will Lead to 51,000 Preventable Deaths Each Year. In a letter sent to Senate leaders on June 3, a team of health experts at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania warn that funding cuts included in the budget reconciliation package narrowly passed by House Republicans last month would lead to 51,000 more people dying across the United States each year.\nThe package, labeled the “big beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, includes deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for lower-income and disabled people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An additional 5.1 million people would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program’s enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.\nThe estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a previous analysis from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to queries from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.\nThe legislation would also repeal federal safe staffing standards that require nursing homes and long-term care facilities to maintain a minimum ratio of nurses to patients in order to provide proper care, which the researchers estimate would result in 13,000 additional deaths annually.\nThe Senate is taking up the “big, beautiful bill” after House Republicans passed the budget package on a razor thin, one-vote margin, despite protests from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans from swing districts. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) requested the analysis on mortality as ranking members on the Senate Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, respectively.\n“In other words, when you throw 13.7 million Americans off the health care they have … when you increase the cost of prescription drugs for low-income seniors, and when you make nursing homes throughout America less safe, not only will some of the most vulnerable people throughout our country suffer, but tens of thousands will die,” Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe latest calculations from public health experts adds to a growing pile of research on the devastating potential impacts of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. If the current bill becomes law, annual cuts to Medicaid would average over $70 billion over the coming years — the same amount millionaires and billionaires would gain in tax cuts each year, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\nEven with those cuts to critical health care programs, the budget package is projected to increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In an open letter to the Senate on Monday, EPI and six Nobel laureate economists said the nation’s structural deficits are already too high, and the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates while reducing incomes for the bottom 40 percent of earners. Taken together, the economists wrote, “the House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income” while adding to the national debt.\n“These steep cuts to the social safety net are being undertaken to defray the staggering cost of the tax cuts included in the House bill, including the hidden cost of preserving the large corporate income tax cut passed in the 2017 tax law,” the economists wrote. “But even these sharp spending cuts will pay for far less than half of the tax cuts (not even including the cost of maintaining the corporate income tax cuts of the 2017 law).”\nThe budget reconciliation package makes cuts to health care funding in multiple ways, although the proposal to impose work requirements on adult Medicaid enrollees has received the most media attention. The researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania focused on three policies impacting three distinct groups: individuals who will lose all Medicaid coverage, lower-income seniors who will lose subsidies that help pay for prescription drugs, and people who are expected to die in nursing homes if the safe staffing requirements are removed.\nAccording to their data, the researchers estimated an additional 51,000 preventable deaths annually, including:\n- 11,300 deaths from the loss of Medicaid or Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, given that CBO first estimated 7.7 million people will lose coverage. That number has since been updated to 10.9 million.\n- 18,200 deaths due to the loss of Medicaid coverage among 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries, causing loss of access to low-income prescription drug subsidies.\n- 13,000 deaths among Medicaid enrollees in nursing homes due to the rollback of 2024 nursing home minimum staffing rule.\nIn addition, the bill does not extend 2021’s enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace insurance plans. If lawmakers allow these tax credits to expire and the rule changes at the Department of Health and Human Services become effective, an estimated 5.1 million people will lose affordable health insurance, leading to an additional estimated 8,811 preventable deaths, bringing the total to at least 51,000.\n“We know that when people are enrolled in Medicaid it saves lives compared to people not having health coverage, and we know the bill will increase churn and disenrollment in Medicaid,” said Rachel Werner, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and co-author of the analysis, in an interview. “It’s estimated that millions will lose coverage, and that will translate to loss of life.”\nPolling consistently shows that cuts to Medicaid and the health care safety net are deeply unpopular, and many rural and lower-income districts in red states depend on Medicaid to keep hospitals and clinics running. Perhaps this explains why Trump has made a show of publicly urging House Republicans not to “touch” Medicaid. Now that Medicaid is indeed on the chopping block, Trump and his allies in Congress are turning to lies and misinformation.\nIn a statement on Monday, the White House said the idea that “people will literally die” due to Medicaid cuts is a “hoax” and a “disgusting lie” told by Democrats. The bill would penalize states that used their own funds to expand Medicaid to cover some immigrants who would not qualify for federal funding; the White House claimed Medicaid would be “strengthened” by removing 1.4 million undocumented immigrants from the rolls. That coverage loss would also extend to documented children and pregnant women under the proposed policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a top health policy think tank.\nTrump and his allies in Congress are also defending controversial Medicaid work requirements included in the House bill, which would require adult recipients to prove that they are working at least 80 hours per month to maintain their health coverage. People with disabilities would also likely be required to prove they qualify for exceptions, and all enrollees would face more paperwork and barriers to coverage. The policy would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over 10 years by kicking people off Medicaid rolls.\nThe White House said on Monday that “4.8 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work,” a claim also made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently told NBC’s Meet the Press that the 4.8 million people are “refusing” to work and will not lose coverage “if they choose too.”\nHowever, as the Washington Post points out, 4.8 million is the number of people estimated to become uninsured due to work requirements, not the number of young men “sitting around and playing video games” instead of getting a job, as Johnson has previously suggested. KFF analysis shows 92 percent of adults on Medicaid are either working or likely qualify for exceptions to work requirements, as most Medicaid enrollees who do not work are caregivers, parents, students, or have a disability.\nArkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, which led to 18,000 adults losing health coverage over the four months before a court stepped in to halt further implementation. A study by Harvard University researchers found the work requirements were effective at cutting Medicaid rolls during that time period but had no effect on employment. Research on other states has found that few programs linked to Medicaid work requirements actually help enrollees find jobs.\nSome Republicans have outright lied about the reconciliation bill, suggesting they are not pursuing Medicaid cuts when they are. Others are resorting to callous mockery. When constituents confronted Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa at a recent town hall with questions about people dying without health coverage, she shrugged and told them: “Well, we all are going to die.”\nAfter a video of the exchange went viral, Ernst doubled down with a bizarre video in what appears to be a graveyard, suggesting that those who are afraid of preventable deaths under the Medicaid cuts are like children who believe in the tooth fairy and should embrace “my lord and savior, Jesus Christ.”\n“Sen. Ernst’s flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires’ pockets … and they just don’t care,” said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.\nThe “big, beautiful bill” will likely undergo changes in the Senate, where conservative fiscal hawks are anxious about increasing the federal deficit, and defenders of public health refuse to blow holes in a safety net that provides coverage for millions of people in order to pay for tax cuts.\n“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said.\nKeep the press free.

U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs extended the block she imposed last week with a temporary restraining order, which allows the Ivy League school to continue enrolling international students as a lawsuit proceeds. Harvard sued the federal government on Friday after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Harvard will continue to take steps to protect the rights of our international students and scholars, members of our community who are vital to the University’s academic mission and community — and whose presence here benefits our country immeasurably,” a university spokesman said in a statement. READ MORE: Trump asks agencies to cut $100 million from Harvard’s federal contracts On Wednesday, the Trump administration introduced a new effort to revoke Harvard’s certification to enroll foreign students. In a letter sent by the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, Todd Lyons, the government gave Harvard 30 days to respond to the alleged grounds for withdrawal, which include accusations that Harvard coordinated with foreign entities and failed to respond sufficiently to antisemitism on campus. The developments unfolded in a courtroom not far from the Harvard campus, where speakers at Thursday’s commencement ceremony stressed the importance of maintaining a diverse and international student body. The dispute over international enrollment at Harvard is the latest escalation in a battle between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college. In April, Noem sent a letter to the school, demanding a range of records related to foreign students, including discipline records and anything related to “dangerous or violent activity.” Noem said it was in response to accusations of antisemitism on Harvard’s campus. WATCH: Kevin O’Leary on Trump’s trade war and battle with Harvard Harvard says it complied. But on May 22, Noem sent a letter saying the school’s response fell short. She said Harvard was being pulled from the federal program that allows colleges to sponsor international students to get U.S. visas. It took effect immediately and prevented Harvard from hosting foreign students in the upcoming school year. In its lawsuit, Harvard argued the government failed to follow administrative procedures and regulations for removing schools from eligibility to host international students, which include giving schools the opportunity to appeal and a 30-day window to respond.

Noem’s earlier letter to Harvard notified the school that its eligibility was revoked immediately. It did not cite any regulations or statutes that Harvard allegedly violated. The Wednesday letter accuses Harvard of violating regulations around reporting requirements and violating an executive order regarding combatting antisemitism.

U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs extended the block she imposed last week with a temporary restraining order, which allows the Ivy League school to continue enrolling international students as a lawsuit proceeds. Harvard sued the federal government on Friday after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked its ability to host foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Harvard will continue to take steps to protect the rights of our international students and scholars, members of our community who are vital to the University’s academic mission and community — and whose presence here benefits our country immeasurably,” a university spokesman said in a statement. READ MORE: Trump asks agencies to cut $100 million from Harvard’s federal contracts On Wednesday, the Trump administration introduced a new effort to revoke Harvard’s certification to enroll foreign students. In a letter sent by the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, Todd Lyons, the government gave Harvard 30 days to respond to the alleged grounds for withdrawal, which include accusations that Harvard coordinated with foreign entities and failed to respond sufficiently to antisemitism on campus. The developments unfolded in a courtroom not far from the Harvard campus, where speakers at Thursday’s commencement ceremony stressed the importance of maintaining a diverse and international student body. The dispute over international enrollment at Harvard is the latest escalation in a battle between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college. In April, Noem sent a letter to the school, demanding a range of records related to foreign students, including discipline records and anything related to “dangerous or violent activity.” Noem said it was in response to accusations of antisemitism on Harvard’s campus. WATCH: Kevin O’Leary on Trump’s trade war and battle with Harvard Harvard says it complied. But on May 22, Noem sent a letter saying the school’s response fell short. She said Harvard was being pulled from the federal program that allows colleges to sponsor international students to get U.S. visas. It took effect immediately and prevented Harvard from hosting foreign students in the upcoming school year. In its lawsuit, Harvard argued the government failed to follow administrative procedures and regulations for removing schools from eligibility to host international students, which include giving schools the opportunity to appeal and a 30-day window to respond.

Noem’s earlier letter to Harvard notified the school that its eligibility was revoked immediately. It did not cite any regulations or statutes that Harvard allegedly violated. The Wednesday letter accuses Harvard of violating regulations around reporting requirements and violating an executive order regarding combatting antisemitism.

In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government’s action violates the First Amendment and will have an “immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.” “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said in its suit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” The school said it plans to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move. The move has thrown campus into disarray days before graduation, Harvard said in the suit. International students who run labs, teach courses, assist professors and participate in Harvard sports are now left deciding whether to transfer or risk losing legal status to stay in the country, according to the filing. The impact is heaviest at graduate schools such as the Harvard Kennedy School, where almost half the student body comes from abroad, and Harvard Business School, which is about one-third international. Along with its impact on current students, the move blocks thousands of students who were planning to come for summer and fall classes. Harvard said it immediately puts the school at a disadvantage as it competes for the world’s top students. Even if it regains the ability to host students, “future applicants may shy away from applying out of fear of further reprisals from the government,” the suit said. If the government’s action stands, Harvard said, the university would be unable to offer admission to new international students for at least the next two academic years. Schools that have that certification withdrawn by the federal government are ineligible to reapply until one year afterward, Harvard said. Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries. The department announced the action Thursday, accusing Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing “anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators” to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism, He said Harvard would not budge on its “its core, legally-protected principles” over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to Harvard’s international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.

            "Trump undermined Biden’s FEMA in North Carolina. Now the cleanup is lagging on his watch.. Trump undermined Biden’s FEMA in North Carolina. Now the cleanup is lagging on his watch.\nAs a candidate, the president spread misinformation about the Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, convincing many survivors that the federal government was out to get them.\nBrandon Rogers fielded calls from as far away as Australia as his community strained to recover from the worst natural disaster ever to hit his slice of western North Carolina. Texts poured in by the hundreds. The influx kept the Haywood County commissioner and his staff busy as they coordinated an unimaginable humanitarian recovery.\nThe messages were distractions. Worse, actually: They were the budding flowers of misinformation, seeds that were planted just days after Hurricane Helene killed scores of people, destroyed entire towns and set western North Carolina on an uncertain, unwieldy path to rebuilding.\nThe hollers of western North Carolina are rather insular, with strong community ties owed in some equal measures to its mountainous geography, poor infrastructure and deep well of history. The storm hitting a place like that produced a greatest hits list of conspiracies: The Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to push people off their land to access lithium deposits; then-President Joe Biden directed the storm to the Republican-heavy area; FEMA assistance was a loan that needed to be repaid at usurious rates.\nRogers received a death threat over the county’s recovery efforts. An email chain letter claiming 28 babies froze to death in FEMA tents appeared in his inbox. Angry citizens from outside the county poured into a commission meeting demanding answers for tragedies that never occurred.\n“It was just people watching this stuff that believed it,” said Rogers, who is a Republican. “I’d be upset, too, if it’s true. But it wasn’t true.”\nThe misinformation deterred countless people from seeking federal assistance, according to Rogers and other local officials, legal aid groups and community nonprofits interviewed by POLITICO over the nearly eight months since Helene ravaged a slice of Appalachia that had never before given a Category 4 hurricane any thought.\nAt one point this winter, just 15 percent of eligible North Carolina households had applied for FEMA assistance. While the North Carolina Office of the State Auditor data shows those numbers have improved, major gaps remain: Of the 6,930 people who are eligible for housing assistance because insurance or charities did not cover costs, more than 3,700 people — 53 percent — are not pursuing available federal aid.\nDisaster experts cautioned against comparing recoveries because they are all unique, but noted that people who refuse federal help often undermine a region’s rebound. That is playing out in North Carolina, where thousands of people have foregone assistance that could pay for basic needs, rebuild nearly 1,000 destroyed and 74,000 damaged homes, and put communities mourning the 107 lives lost across the state back together.\nThere was one prominent person seizing on the misinformation for his own purposes: Donald Trump. As a candidate, Trump leveled the baseless accusation that the Biden administration was diverting FEMA assistance from North Carolina to house illegal immigrants. He claimed $1 billion of FEMA spending was “stolen” for migrants. He said all FEMA had to offer people in North Carolina was $750, which was not true.\nThe allegations spurred anger toward Biden, but FEMA’s statistics show no significant uptick in aid since Trump’s inauguration. As of April 22, the agency had given nearly $432 million of assistance to 158,600 households in North Carolina, $100 million of which came under Trump, FEMA said in a statement. FEMA also obligated nearly $459 million in public assistance to repair infrastructure in North Carolina, including $138 million under Trump.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s FEMA has halted $10 billion in disaster relief funds intended to help people across the country, cut off housing assistance for thousands of Helene survivors and ended a policy of fully reimbursing the state of North Carolina for debris removal.\nNow, in further evidence of how political attacks can create a reality of their own, Trump officials are using FEMA’s struggles in western North Carolina as a rationale to dismantle the agency.\n“I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away,” Trump said during a January visit to Asheville to survey the damage shortly after taking office.\nAt a congressional hearing on May 6, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA, called the agency a failure and reiterated that Trump believes “FEMA as it exists today should be eliminated.” Trump fired then-acting FEMA chief Cameron Hamilton on May 8, just one day after Hamilton told a House committee the agency should not be abolished. His replacement, David Richardson, warned staff: “I will run right over you.”\nStaff reductions, programmatic cuts and leadership changes at FEMA have raised questions about the preparedness of the nation’s premier disaster response agency. Its performance will be closely watched as the nation readies for the Atlantic hurricane season, which federal forecasters will preview Thursday.\nNeither the White House nor FEMA responded to questions about Trump’s past claims about FEMA’s Helene efforts. DHS also did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs to the president’s plans for FEMA, a White House official said the federal government will focus “on truly catastrophic disasters” while continuing to provide assistance for search-and-rescue missions after devastating events. But the official said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience,” and that Trump’s policies aim to prod them into more proactive posture.\n“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk,” the official said, saying states must have their own “commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem.”\nWhatever the policy merits of Trump’s disaster-relief plans, they feel like a bait and switch to some people struggling to recover from Helene: After blaming Biden for faltering relief efforts, Trump has seemed more focused on trashing FEMA than boosting the recovery in North Carolina.\nTravis Gresham of Canton, a town 20 miles west of Asheville, accuses Trump of setting FEMA up to fail. The president’s conspiracy-laced campaign attacks convinced her neighbors to shun the agency, which has delayed reconstruction of a private road and bridge, Gresham said. The surrounding community fell into the false claims like Biden pushed a button to send the hurricane to western North Carolina, that FEMA is merely a tool of the Democratic Party, and that the agency wanted to clear the land for lithium mining. Her neighbors believe everything Trump says because they view him as a “golden god,” Gresham said.\n“He knew what he was doing,” said Gresham, who often votes for Democratic candidates. “He was setting the stage for what his agenda was: That FEMA is a joke. It’s not a good system, but I don’t think there’s a plan to fix it or overhaul it and make it better. I think it’s a plan to eliminate it.”\n“If you take the boots off the ground here the people are not going to try to get the help. The help will be over,” Gresham added. “I don’t think we will ever recover here. Not fully.”\nImmediately after Helene struck, candidate Trump made clear that disaster relief was a federal responsibility and that blame for recovery failures rested with Biden.\n“They sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South,” he posted Sept. 30 on Truth Social. “Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have ‘leaders’ who have no idea how to lead!”\nHis criticisms found a receptive audience in western North Carolina, the region’s residents said. There’s a deep mistrust of the federal government in those rural communities. Locals draw pride from self-sufficiency, maintaining generational ties to the land. It’s also nearly devoid of local news outlets, making it the type of environment where anti-government conspiracy theories flourish.\n“Appalachia is much more of a mirror of America than we’re willing to fully embrace or realize,” said Ryan Eller, executive director of Appalachia Funders Network, a philanthropy that invests in the region. “We’re kind of a canary in a coal mine if we continue to have this degradation of local press, of trust, and allow the response infrastructure for storms not to meet the moment that we’re in where these storms are so frequent and destructive.”\nTrump visited western North Carolina four days after his inauguration, just weeks after Vice President JD Vance toured the region during the presidential transition. It was at that January appearance when Trump first suggested that FEMA should be abolished.\nMany officials in western North Carolina agree that FEMA needs changing. Even longtime FEMA officials acknowledge that the agency’s rules can be cumbersome, especially for people under duress after a catastrophe. Local aid workers familiar with the way FEMA operates said people often mistakenly fail to appeal FEMA denials of assistance, which are routine enough to be more of a feature of the system than a bug. The money comes too slowly, as some people interviewed for this article are still waiting on federal dollars to rebuild after Tropical Storm Fred hit the area in 2021.\nBut those complaints have been overshadowed by the numerous unwieldy conspiracies that sprouted in Helene’s aftermath — that FEMA never arrived, that it stole supplies, that it took property, that it ran out of money because it spent it on assisting migrants, former FEMA officials, aid workers and community organizers said.\nPoliticians in red pockets of the country — which absorb far more FEMA assistance than heavily Democratic areas — are walking a fine line. They want FEMA to remain on the ground. But as they decry misinformation and call for reforms, they stop short of blaming Trump for amplifying the very misinformation that now threatens the agency’s future. They do not want to offend Trump or his supporters, but now face the challenge of balancing partisan anger with local needs to preserve some semblance of the agency they’ve loudly criticized.\n“I think he’s correct in calling out the fact that they failed us,” state Rep. Mark Pless, a Republican, said of Trump. “It doesn’t give credibility to the stories and the lies that are being spread. Just because he said FEMA failed us does not make these stories credible.”\nBefore the misinformation came clear, accurate information from the National Weather Service: Helene would soon bring catastrophic flooding, property damage and death to western North Carolina.\nThe weather service is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation’s primary climate and weather research service. It’s a public-safety agency that informs people of imminent storms. Its meteorologists work in field offices around the country, developing relationships with mayors, local emergency managers and often TV weather people — who are among the most trusted local celebrities, according to polling.\nThe warnings from the National Weather Service office covering western North Carolina proved prescient. Its first post on the social media site X at 12:16 p.m. Sept. 24 stated, “Tropical Storm #Helene has now formed & will impact us later this week. It is a very large storm & we can expect VERY heavy rainfall & gusty winds.” Less than six hours later, the agency said its confidence of significant flood threats beginning Sept. 26 continued to increase, with “potential to be an extremely rare event.”\nSuccessive posts noted severe flash flooding, strong winds and power outages were likely. On Sept. 25 — one day before Helene hit the Florida panhandle — the weather service predicted between 10 and 15 inches of total rainfall and put the area under a tropical storm warning. North Carolina would meet Helene within 36 hours, the meteorologists cautioned.\nHelene arrived Sept. 27. The strongest gusts measured up to 105 mph in the southern Appalachian Mountains, according to NOAA’s National Hurricane Center. Rainfall between 20 and 31 inches, dropping at rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, flooded the region’s rocky crags. Most of the storm’s 34 flash-flood emergencies occurred in western North Carolina.\nThe National Hurricane Center now counts Helene as “the most devastating natural disaster in western North Carolina’s history,” killing 107 people, destroying 822,000 acres of timber land, demolishing or damaging tens of thousands of homes.\nHelene even forced the temporary closure of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, the Asheville office that produces an annual report of U.S. natural disasters causing $1 billion in damage. (Trump canceled that report and ceased updating its public database this month, citing “evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.”) Just about everyone at the office knows someone who lost their home or a loved one in the storm, NCEI physical scientist Jared Rennie said. Even with an incredibly accurate NWS forecast that gave people days to evacuate, scores of North Carolinians perished.\n“I have meteorologist survivor’s guilt,” he said. “It hurts. Even to this day.”\nRennie was aware that skepticism of climate change had bred distrust of the federal government in this corner of North Carolina, a mountainous area of rural villages surrounding the city of Asheville, which is noted for its literary past. While affluent Asheville itself is politically liberal, the surrounding area is among the poorest and most conservative in the state. The two hardest hit neighboring counties — Avery and Haywood — voted 76.4 and 61.6 percent for Trump in 2016, 75.8 and 62.5 percent in 2020 and 75.7 and 61.8 percent in 2024, respectively.\nRennie sometimes speaks about climate science to rural audiences, and has seen the distrust up close, even as catastrophic storms made the risk to average people more vivid: A collective of researchers using advanced computer models said climate change had made Helene wetter and windier, dramatically increasing the risk to western North Carolina.\nBut the type of misinformation targeting the federal government that Rennie witnessed after Hurricane Helene differed from the climate skepticism he’s battled in the past. Community members complained that FEMA was absent when Rennie said he himself had witnessed FEMA officials on the ground. Some of the criticism may have gained credibility from the amount of time it took for FEMA to navigate dangerous terrain and reach far-flung homes. Roads and bridges were destroyed, swallowed by crested rivers or sawed in half by fallen boulders. Entire towns like Swannanoa and Chimney Rock were wiped out. Internet and cellular phone service evaporated. People felt they were on their own.\n“Disinformation can spread like wildfire,” Rennie said. “My personal opinion is that created that whole rift of, ‘Oh, FEMA is the bad guy.’”\nThe most pernicious rumor was that Helene survivors could only get $750, a misreading of federal policy. That was the amount that survivors could get under a new FEMA policy introduced in March 2024 to give them immediate cash in addition to other available assistance. It was the first hurricane season with that new funding, which FEMA believed would help build confidence in the agency. But Trump spread the misinformation that $750 was all that FEMA would offer North Carolina residents.\n“What’s happened there is very bad. They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away,” Trump said at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, eliciting a round of boos from the crowd. “And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.”\nTrump’s megaphone became difficult to overcome.\n“It was very hard to get past that message that $750 isn’t the only assistance available,” said Alicia Edwards, disaster relief project director with Legal Aid for North Carolina, which offers free legal services to low-income residents. “It was surprising. I wasn’t prepared for that.”\nUnlike Florida, Texas and other coastal areas more prone to hurricanes and accustomed to working with FEMA, western North Carolina had never experienced this level of destruction — or had as much of an occasion to contend with FEMA’s bureaucracy. Elderly and less tech-savvy residents struggled to navigate it. Many people gave up when they hit common FEMA obstacles, such as providing specific documentation, Edwards and other local aid workers said.\nOther survivors came to believe falsehoods that FEMA assistance was a government loan. In more sinister versions, FEMA would take children or property if people could not repay those fictitious loans. Scores of residents chose to live in tents on their property to ward off FEMA, said Rogers, the Haywood County commissioner.\nThere were claims that ranged from ridiculous to the tin-foil-hat variety: That FEMA was never there at all or that its officials were absconding with people’s personal supplies and tents, according to residents, aid workers and a review of internet rumors.\nEven months after the storm, the perception that FEMA worked against the interests of reeling North Carolina communities lingers.\nBobby Minor is a 71-year-old man who lived in the Asheville area before moving 140 miles to the east to Advance, which was not directly affected by the hurricane. In an effort to help his former neighbors, he and his wife brought and delivered basic goods on several trips to the areas since Helene hit. He said in an interview that under the Biden administration, FEMA had purposely stinted on aid to the conservative mountainous region, claiming that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first appeared one week after Trump’s January visit. (In fact, the Army Corps said it arrived in the state Sept. 26 to establish operational support for FEMA and arrived in western North Carolina by Sept. 29.)\n“Most people say, ‘We haven’t even seen them,’” Minor said of FEMA. “Sounds like that is almost by design.”\nAs those perceptions of being left behind quickly swelled into anti-FEMA sentiment, politicians seized on the opportunity to capitalize on the growing distrust of government officials at every level of government, local officials said.\nIn Haywood County, commissioner Terry Ramey joined a YouTube channel run by Tennessee-based influencer John Ward, which was the source of many false claims. On the channel, Ramey asserted that the county itself had blocked temporary shelter for Helene survivors. The county’s four other commissioners and Pless, the county’s state representative, rebuked Ramey. Neither Ward nor Ramey responded to requests for comment.\n“I’ve sat back there and I’ve kind of vibrated while I’ve watched this show — and this is a show. And there are a lot of people sitting in this room that need to go home,” Pless said at the meeting. “Terry, this is to you: You can sit there all day long, and you can say you ain’t started nothing. Everybody knows it’s a lie. The bad part is is these people are going to turn on you the second that you don’t do something they want to do.”\nInflamed by the anti-government sentiments, several citizen groups interfered with FEMA’s delivery of humanitarian-relief supplies when they continued their own supply runs out of the Hickory, Lincolnton and Statesville airports even after the state asked them to stand down, said Mark Bumgarner, executive director of Catawba County United Way. He said those groups of citizens hoped to throttle FEMA’s operations because they did not believe its aid would reach local people.\n“This got a bit tricky for us as politicians who were involved with these groups at the airports,” Bumgarner wrote in an email. “Don’t get me wrong, the citizen groups provided a much-needed service the first couple of days before FEMA could fully mobilize. But in the developing FEMA involvement, I was shocked they were feeding misinformation to folks looking to donate.”\nIt didn’t help that Trump “utilized fear” to politicize the disaster, said Amber Dixon, director of community health initiatives at the Boone, North Carolina-based Western Youth Network.\n“I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,” Trump wrote Sept. 30 on Truth Social. That same day, he said on Fox News that, “They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas. … They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”\nDixon said she worried that politicization would prolong the area’s recovery by dissuading people from pursuing help — fears that have since come to pass.\n“If you look at the number of FEMA applications versus the number of impacted households, there’s a huge discrepancy,” she said just days before Trump’s January inauguration. “It’s a numbers game. If you continually tell someone that you don’t need something, then that resource will, by default, go away.”\nDonella Pressley has heard it all.\n“If you didn’t see them you had your blinders on, because they were here,” Pressley said of FEMA.\nThe 50-year-old Canton resident has zero reason to defend FEMA. She’s spent several frustrating years working with the agency trying to rebuild a home destroyed by Tropical Storm Fred in 2021. Since that time, Pressley and her two children have bounced between staying with friends and in hotels. Last year, FEMA finally began disbursing money. The money stopped when Trump took over — FEMA ceased paying hotel bills for thousands of North Carolinians this winter.\nPressley said FEMA needs simplifying and fixing, sure. But “that doesn’t start with getting rid of it,” she said. “It works for some. It may not be working for everyone. But I don’t see disasters stopping.”\nEven some FEMA critics at Helene’s ground zero, which was 30 minutes east of Pressley’s home, said they need the agency’s help. Congressional Republicans also said they don’t want FEMA to disappear from the scene entirely. Yet the misinformation that swirled around FEMA after Helene has further politicized the agency, shaking its foundation as the nation’s premier first responders to climate-fueled disasters.\n“FEMA shouldn’t really be subject to political debates or even the tides that shift from ideological pole to pole,” said Eller, of the Appalachia Funders Network. “I don’t think disasters are partisan, and so the recovery shouldn’t be either. And I just think that FEMA needs stable, sufficient funding to operate at the scale of today’s climate reality and the demands of our communities.”\nNow, western North Carolina continues to suffer, but it is unclear how much longer FEMA officials will remain on the ground.\nEnding FEMA’s role in long-term recovery would remove from western North Carolina the scores of officials assisting people like Pressley in processing forms for housing assistance from earlier disasters. Officials would have to end or cut back on efforts to help communities plan early for ways to rebuild bridges and roads, restore power grids and clear debris.\nThe changes are already happening. On March 29, FEMA pulled out of its North Carolina disaster recovery centers without explanation. In April, it stopped providing 100 percent reimbursement for state recovery expenses, leaving North Carolina to figure out how it will pay for the rest of its work.\nTrump’s FEMA has closed the spigot on other funds, too. It halted disbursement from $10 billion of disaster relief programs to assess whether those funds flow to illegal immigrants — an evolution of the misinformation that Trump himself spouted on the campaign trail.\nA FEMA retreat would hurt North Carolinians struggling to recover from Helene, said Max Gibbons, director of pro bono services with Pisgah Legal Services. He acknowledged many “hiccups” in FEMA’s cumbersome process, but insisted that state and local governments cannot fill the void.\n“We see that every single day where FEMA is their one source of recovery,” Gibbons said of his clients, many of whom have endured generations of family poverty. “Without the federal funding it would be difficult for the state to meet the need.”\nThose needs will grow. Climate change has intensified and made events like Helene more frequent — some of the FEMA officials deployed to North Carolina were in Florida just days before to respond to Hurricane Milton. More people now live in areas vulnerable to disasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires than ever before. Last year, the U.S. experienced 27 disasters totaling $1 billion in damage. It was the second-highest number of such events in one year, behind only the 28 in 2023.\nTrump’s FEMA is cutting programs that would blunt the effects of those storms, said Michael Coen, who was FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations. In April, FEMA canceled billions of dollars in funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program that started in Trump’s first term, steering funding away from projects designed to reduce damage before disasters strike. Coen noted Trump also took an unprecedented step by withholding hazard mitigation grant funding in an April disaster declaration for Virginia, a largely routine measure that unlocks money to safeguard infrastructure from future disasters.\nEfforts to buy flooded homes from residents seeking to move on from vulnerable properties may also fall victim to Trump’s cuts, Coen added. Congress increased that funding with $3.5 billion in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, but much of it remains unspent. The rumors of FEMA taking North Carolina property against people’s will damaged the program’s reputation.\nOn top of that, seasoned FEMA leaders are expected to be pushed out or laid off amid the massive cuts and reorganization, said a former senior FEMA official who was granted anonymity to avoid retribution. That could leave the agency unprepared for the hurricane season that begins June 1.\nSome past leaders believe FEMA has been stretched too thin by increasingly frequent disasters and needs to be streamlined, with some of its functions passed off to other federal agencies.\nBrock Long, who ran FEMA in the first Trump administration, told a climate tech conference in Washington last month that the agency has become “a dumping ground for all the nation’s complex problems,” ranging from dealing with unhoused populations to restoring power grids. He said states and private insurers need to shoulder more of the load. But he said the federal government should maintain a role.\n“It’s a relatively misunderstood agency with great intentions,” he said at the April event.\nMany simply want speedier responses to disasters that pile up one on top of the other. They want less bureaucracy to get money for rebuilding.\n“We had folks here that were literally boots on the ground the morning after the storm,” Rogers said of FEMA. “Unless they’ve got the open checkbook at that moment it’s like, ‘What are you doing?’”\nRogers intimately understands the many levels of frustration in the response, but he has also seen what ills can come of government skepticism. He stared them in the face at a three-plus hour Dec. 2, 2024, commission meeting, where he responded to accusations about FEMA and the county. He ticked off a long list of responses to conspiracies about the county and FEMA: “There has been zero kids took out of a tent, a camper, anything because of this flood situation” and “we do not want to seize anybody’s property,” among others.\nRogers lamented how misinformation besieged and complicated the recovery. How it infiltrated his neighbors’ minds and conversations. How it all could contribute to dismantling FEMA — which, for all its faults, is still in the thick of it, trying to get Haywood County back on its feet.\n“I would like to see them engage with the system,” Rogers said of his constituents in an interview. “I want them to get the help that they deserve.”",

READ MORE: Experts concerned over cuts to key federal agencies as hurricane season starts The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Erick had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph). The cyclone was rapidly intensifying and is expected to become a major hurricane. Erick was located in the eastern Pacific Ocean about 105 miles (165 kilometers) south of Puerto Ángel and about 215 miles (345 kilometers) southeast of Punta Maldonado. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lighter amounts in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain. The hurricane center said Erick is rapidly intensifying and is expected to be at or near major hurricane status as it approaches the Mexican coast on Thursday, where it could make landfall. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph). Erick is forecast to be a major hurricane by Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The storm’s projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort’s hotels. Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick’s possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico’s national civil defense coordinator, said Wednesday that Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides and there are numerous rivers that could jump their banks. Thousands of troops were being deployed to the area, Velázquez said. Guerrero Gov.

President Claudia Sheinbaum during her daily news briefing Wednesday warned residents in the hurricane’s path to listen for government instructions and to wait it out in their homes or government shelters.

            "Experts concerned over cuts to key federal agencies as hurricane season starts. By — Seth Borenstein, Associated Press Seth Borenstein, Associated Press By — Gabriela Aoun Angueira, Associated Press Gabriela Aoun Angueira, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/experts-concerned-over-cuts-to-key-federal-agencies-as-hurricane-season-starts Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Experts concerned over cuts to key federal agencies as hurricane season starts Nation May 31, 2025 1:44 PM EDT WASHINGTON (AP) — With predictions for a busy hurricane season beginning Sunday, experts in storms and disasters are worried about something potentially as chaotic as the swirling winds: Massive cuts to the federal system that forecasts, tracks and responds to hurricanes. Experts are alarmed over the large-scale staff reductions, travel and training restrictions and grant cut-offs since President Donald Trump took office at both the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which prepares for and responds to hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks and forecasts them. “My nightmare is a major catastrophic storm hitting an area that is reeling from the impact of all of this nonsense from the Trump administration and people will die. And that could happen in Florida, that could happen in Texas, that could happen in South Carolina,” said Susan Cutter, the director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. Representatives of both NOAA and FEMA say the agencies are prepared. Experts: DOGE cuts diminish FEMA About 2,000 full-time staff have left FEMA since Trump took office in January, a loss of roughly one-third of the agency’s full-time workforce, amid Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) mandated cuts. Scholars who study emergency management are concerned by both the reduction in capacity and the “brain drain” of experienced staff. “There’s really been a brain drain within FEMA in addition to the loss of overall employees,” said Samantha Montano, who teaches emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. She noted that many who left were in critical management positions. The agency is run by an acting chief, David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer who served overseas and worked as the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction. He does not appear to have any experience in managing disasters. Emergency management requires knowing where to get things, who to call, how things work and how to get it done quickly — which comes from experience and establishing relationships with state officials, Montano and Cutter said. What’s happening reminds former Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate of 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana and exposed inexperienced and poorly prepared governments at all levels, especially the then-FEMA chief who came from a horse-rearing association. Fugate said he’s especially worried about top experienced disaster people leaving FEMA. FEMA canceled various emergency management trainings this spring, moved others online and restricted travel to events such as the National Hurricane Conference. Some trainings have resumed. “Given the reduction in staffing, being unable to do trainings, participate in conferences, there’s potential that the federal government’s ability is diminished,” said former Florida Emergency Management chief Bryan Koon, now president of the disaster preparedness firm IEM. FEMA has also cut disaster resilience programs. Making areas more survivable saves up to $13 for every dollar spent, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. The federal government promises to be ready for hurricane season, which runs through November. “FEMA is shifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,” Associate FEMA Administrator Geoff Harbaugh said in a email. “FEMA is fully activated in preparation for hurricane season.” FEMA’s relationship with states Richardson promised to push more responsibilities to the states. He warned that the agency will only do what the law requires and shift more costs to states. But Koon noted that states haven’t budgeted for FEMA’s changes, adding: “The biggest issue right now is just the uncertainty.” Some states — which coordinate disaster operations — are experienced in catastrophes, have well trained staff and will do fine, such as Texas and Florida, Fugate said. But it’s the poorer states that worry the experts. The feds often pick up the entire bill in big disasters and most of it in smaller ones. In the Trump administration, disaster declarations have been denied or delayed. When disaster declarations were issued for nine states last week, some had been pending for two months and others were only partially approved. “We’ve just relied on FEMA for so much for so long and not knowing who’s going to fill the gap and how we’re going to fill it is really scary,” said University at Albany emergency management professor Jeannette Sutton. Hurricane center dodges NOAA cuts NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, has undergone a series of dramatic job cuts, with some people then reinstated. A sizable chunk of the weather service’s 121 local field offices as of late March had vacancy rates of more than 20%, what’s seen by outsiders as a critical level of understaffing. Local weather offices are crucial in helping people translate national warnings into what to do locally. “It should be all hands on deck and we’re being hollowed out,” former NWS director Louis Uccellini said. But the National Hurricane Center, which tracks and warns of hurricanes in the Atlantic, Pacific and Caribbean, has been spared. Acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm, National Weather Service Director Ken Graham and National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said the agency is prepared for the season with the Miami-based storm center fully staffed and so are the planes that fly into storms. For the first time this year, the hurricane center will incorporate artificial intelligence into forecasting because it has shown to improve predictions generally, Brennan said. “Our services have never been better,” Graham said. “Our ability to serve this country has never been better. And it will be this year as well.” But beyond the hurricane center, weather balloons launches have been curtailed because of lack of staffing. In some places, balloon launches have dropped from twice a day to once a day. NOAA hopes to get more balloons launched if needed, Brennan said. Data from the balloons is crucial for understanding steering currents and needed for forecasts, Uccellini said. He said when hurricanes threatened during his tenure he would order the launch of several extra balloons in the Great Plains to help figure out if storms would hit the United States. “Hurricane forecasts, I’m expecting not to be as accurate this year because of that lack of balloon data,″ said former NOAA meteorologist Jeff Masters, now at Yale Climate Connections.

For the first time this year, the hurricane center will incorporate artificial intelligence into forecasting because it has shown to improve predictions generally, Brennan said. “Our services have never been better,” Graham said. “Our ability to serve this country has never been better. And it will be this year as well.” But beyond the hurricane center, weather balloons launches have been curtailed because of lack of staffing. In some places, balloon launches have dropped from twice a day to once a day. NOAA hopes to get more balloons launched if needed, Brennan said. Data from the balloons is crucial for understanding steering currents and needed for forecasts, Uccellini said. He said when hurricanes threatened during his tenure he would order the launch of several extra balloons in the Great Plains to help figure out if storms would hit the United States. “Hurricane forecasts, I’m expecting not to be as accurate this year because of that lack of balloon data,″ said former NOAA meteorologist Jeff Masters, now at Yale Climate Connections.

            "G7 summit to focus on trade, wars &mdash; and avoiding conflict with Trump.

If there is a shared mission at this year’s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada’s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions. WATCH: Former U.S. ambassador to Israel analyzes rising Israel-Iran conflict The 2018 summit ended with Trump assailing his Canadian hosts on social media as he departed on Air Force One, saying he had instructed the U.S. officials who remained in Quebec to oppose the G7 joint statement endorsed by the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and, of course, Canada. “I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!” Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter. This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program. Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China’s continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains. Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: “We have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, ‘This is what you’re going to have to pay.’ But I think we’ll have a few, few new trade deals.” At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa. What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn’t just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies. “The big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that’s where that famous photo comes from,” said Peter Boehm, Canada’s counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. “I think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.” The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts. “Well, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that’s important,” U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada. There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military. “The Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,” said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump’s team for the G7 in Trump’s first term. The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers’ meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems. The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation. Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official. The U.S. president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire. The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts. Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump’s first term. The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it’s unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend. That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they’re better off siding with the U.S. than China. “Trump will try to coordinate the group against China’s economic coercion,” Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. “But the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren’t imposing tariffs on his allies.” Boak reported from Calgary, Alberta.

            "Two major U.S. food producers to remove artificial dyes from products sold domestically. Two major food producers say that they will be pulling artificial dyes from their U.S. products starting in 2027.\nThe shift comes nearly two months after U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to phase out petroleum-based artificial colors.\nKraft Heinz said Tuesday that it will be removing artificial dyes from its U.S. products beginning in 2027 and will no longer roll out new products with the dyes. Hours later, General Mills announced that it plans to remove artificial dyes from all of its U.S. cereals and all foods served in K-12 schools by the summer of 2026.

            "'A definitive backslide.' Inside fashion's worrying runway trend. Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it’s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.\nAcross runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK — the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.\nIn recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic — which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide — have been widely reported as Hollywood’s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her “anti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody” while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.\nFor many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.\nThe Fall-Winter failings\nIn 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways — or many others.\nFendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\nAccording to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.\n“It was a definitive backslide,” said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. “It was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.” Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n“Watching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,” White continued. “They wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn’t want to be reflective on their runways.”\nFor others, even the term “backslide” was too generous. “Slipping back from… what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many ‘plus-size’ and ‘mid-size’ women as ‘straight-size’ women?” fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season’s runways. “No one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.”\nThat said, a handful of — mostly smaller — brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O’Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas — a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity — staged one of the city’s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.\nThere was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed’s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show — which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.\nIt starts with sample size\nFashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.\nIt’s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. “I want to be ahead of that,” White said. “So I’m never told ‘Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn’t have her size’ or whatever that conversation might look like.”\nBut despite her efforts, she says she’s frequently told it’s too much of a “financial lift” to make larger samples — even by legacy brands. “I get very upset when brands say that,” White said. “I don’t believe that it is, I believe that it’s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.”\nBeyond the lack of representation, White notes it’s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities — all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.\nLondon-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot— an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her “horrified,” Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model’s shame and embarrassment. “Looking into this girl’s eyes,” Burns said, “she shouldn’t have felt like that.”\nBurns’ post, which called the current system “unacceptable,” was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) “Ultimately, the desire to see change has to be there,” Burns said. “And I wonder whether luxury has that desire?”\nA case for change\nProgress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. “I see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they’re great offerings,” said White. “Great, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That’s what I don’t want.”\nFor British Vogue’s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed “The New Supers.” Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for “leading the way” and holding “powerful space” in the industry.\n“Catwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,” read the magazine’s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. “But this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.”\nBut many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.\nIn his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. “I thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood… one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.”\nBut for White, the power rests within the entire industry — not just at the feet of brands. “I really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,” she continued. “If there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.”\nBurns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. “I think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,” she said. “It’s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.”\n‘No such thing as a free lunch’\nOn March 8, Wegovy — developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions — was approved in the UK. It’s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country’s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.\nSimilarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.\nWhile these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.\nSemaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). “It can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,” said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.\nOn March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. “Any other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,” read the release.\nPatients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term “Ozempic Face,” coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled “Life After Food?” Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.\nAnd across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.\n“I was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,” said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. “I’m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,” she said.\nAlthough she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). “I’ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,” she told CNN.\nDr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. “If somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,” he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. “These drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\nEvery body is invited\nFashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue — regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.\n“There’s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they’re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don’t have the resources to buy into luxury,” said White. “The reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.”\nNot only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.\n“It shouldn’t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we’re not just looking at a single view of beauty,” echoed Burns.\nEster Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season’s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: “The body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.”",
            "FDA Approved Hundreds of Drugs Without Evidence They Work. Many Are Dangerous.. Nieraj Jain was puzzled by the patient sitting quietly in front of him. The woman, in her 60s, was losing her eyesight; that much was clear. Her vision was blurred, and she was having increasing difficulty seeing at night and in bright sunlight. Less obvious was the cause. A retinal specialist and surgeon at Emory University in Georgia, Jain pored over specialized scans of her eye and saw odd patches of pigment on her retina — patches that didn’t fit with any known diagnosis.\nA fleeting memory pulled him up short; hadn’t he seen another patient a few months before with a similar finding? Combing through patient records, Jain dug up five more patients at Emory with the same puzzling retinal changes. All were going blind — and all happened to be taking Elmiron, a drug for a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis. In 2018, Jain and his colleagues published their findings about this new cause of blindness, dubbing it “pigmentary maculopathy.”\nMeanwhile, gastroenterologists at Emory and other institutions were uncovering another troubling finding about Elmiron: Some patients on the drug were being diagnosed with colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with potentially life-threatening complications.\nAccording to a government database analyzed by The Lever and the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at CUNY’s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, by the end of 2024, hundreds of patients on Elmiron had suffered vision loss or blindness. Others taking the drug were even more unlucky. Dozens of patient deaths associated with Elmiron were reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 45 patients were hospitalized with severe colitis.\nAnother problem? There’s no good evidence that Elmiron works.\nWhen the government approved Elmiron in 1996, the manufacturer provided close to zero data that the drug effectively treated interstitial cystitis. Regulators allowed Elmiron on the market only on the proviso that the company conduct a second study to determine if it worked. It would take 18 years for the various companies that bought and sold the drug’s license to produce that study — and it proved to be a resounding bust. Patients who took Elmiron did no better than those given a sugar pill. (Janssen, which manufactures Elmiron, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)\nAll of which raises a question: How could a drug with such serious side effects get on the market in the first place? And how could it stay on the market for nearly three decades, even after subsequent studies failed to show it was effective? The answer to both questions strikes at the heart of what ails the FDA today.\nElmiron is just one of hundreds of drugs that have been approved by the FDA over the last several decades on the basis of flimsy or nonexistent evidence. Drug companies have been allowed to market hundreds of prescription drugs to doctors and sell them to unsuspecting patients despite glaringly inadequate evidence that they offer any benefit and in many cases amid clear signs that they pose a risk of serious, often irreparable harm.\nFrom January 2013 until Dec. 31, 2022, the FDA approved 429 drugs, most of which were authorized on the basis of inadequate evidence that they worked, according to a database of government records created for this investigation. Based on an analysis of these records, the agency has allowed dozens of treatments, like Elmiron, to remain on the market even when subsequent studies failed to show they are effective. This investigation found that from 2013 through 2022:\n- Seventy-three percent of drugs approved by the FDA did not meet the agency’s four foundational standards required to show they work as expected.\n- More than half of drug approvals were based on preliminary data rather than sound evidence that patients had fewer symptoms, improved function, or lived longer.\n- Fifty-five of the 429 drugs approved met only one of the four standards needed to show that a drug is safe and effective; 39 drugs met none of them.\nMany of the issues with drug approvals uncovered in this investigation are particularly concerning with regard to cancer treatments.\n- Only 2.4 percent of the 123 cancer drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 met all four of the FDA’s scientific criteria. Twenty-nine drugs — 23 percent — met none.\n- Eighty-one percent of cancer drugs were approved based on preliminary evidence rather than data showing patients would live longer. Studies of cancer drugs approved on preliminary evidence have failed to show they improve survival in the vast majority of cases.\nThese statistics come after billions of dollars and years of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry and patient advocacy groups pressuring Congress to loosen the FDA’s scientific standards.\nThe resulting seismic shift from proving drugs work before they are approved to showing they work only after approval — if ever — has been quietly accomplished with virtually no awareness by doctors or the public. Insurers and taxpayers effectively pay for research after drugs hit the market as pharmaceutical companies reap the profits. Patients serve as the unwitting guinea pigs — with very real consequences.\nIn the U.S. alone, an estimated 128,000 people are killed each year by side effects of prescription drugs that are properly prescribed. That number excludes opioid overdoses and is more than deaths from all illegal drugs combined. And the rate at which the agency approves unproven drugs has accelerated dramatically in the last 10 years.\nThese are just some of the findings of a two-year investigation by The Lever and the McGraw Center into all 429 new drugs approved from 2013 through 2022. A team of four experts, three of whom are physicians and one a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated the scientific studies cited by the agency in its approval decisions.\nIn addition, the authors used government reports, internal FDA documents, investigators’ notes, congressional testimony, court records, and interviews with more than 100 researchers, legal scholars, current and former federal officials, patients, and their families.\nA 14-member advisory committee including physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, a patient advocate, an FDA insider, and an FDA advisor provided guidance for the investigation. Several of the advisers vetted the findings for accuracy.\nThese experts were shocked by some of this investigation’s findings.\n“I’ve been discouraged about the FDA before, but the last few years have been the worst,” said one of those advisers, Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit National Center for Health Research. “The scientific bar is often so low it would be impossible to lower it much further.”\nExamining the nation’s drug approval process has gained urgency in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive orders demanding federal agencies deregulate numerous industries. And while Martin Makary, Trump’s pick for FDA commissioner, has written widely about medical error and the need for more rigorous medical science, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is known for his unsupported claims about medicines and vaccines.\nExperts say the current political reality doesn’t bode well for a drug-approval process that’s already plagued by deficiencies.\n“We need an agency that’s independent from the industry it regulates and that uses high quality science to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs,” says Reshma Ramachandran, a co-director of the Yale Collaboration for Regulatory Rigor, Integrity, and Transparency and an expert in analyzing clinical trials, “Without that, we might as well go back to the days of snake oil and patent medicines.”\n“We Opened Pandora’s Box”\nBetween drugs, food, dietary supplements, tobacco, and medical devices, the FDA regulates $3.9 trillion worth of products each year, roughly one-eighth of the entire U.S. economy. With a budget of approximately $6.9 billion in 2024, hundreds of offices in the U.S. and abroad, and more than 19,000 full-time employees (prior to recent firings), the FDA’s resources and scope make it one of the most powerful agencies in the country and highly influential around the world.\nIts reputation was built on hard-won scientific standards put into place by Congress in 1938 and 1962 after a string of medical tragedies. These new laws, sometimes called “super-statutes” because they are so far-reaching, authorized the agency to require drug companies to provide evidence that their drugs are safe and effective before they could go on the market.\nThen came AIDS. By 1988, the epidemic was in full swing: 46,000 people had died, and another 37,000 were living in the U.S. with the poorly understood condition. AIDS activist groups wanted access to new drugs — and fast. With news cameras rolling, activists blockaded the entrance to FDA headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, holding placards saying “Federal Death Administration,” and lying on the street holding cardboard tombstones that read “Killed by the FDA.”\nActivists found ready partners in drugmakers, who were eager to get their products to market. Together, the activists and companies argued before the FDA that the compassionate, lifesaving strategy would be to loosen scientific standards for establishing the efficacy of drugs.\nAmong those existing standards was the strong recommendation that companies submit two or more randomized, controlled clinical trials that show a drug is effective in order to win approval. That’s because any single study, no matter how well it’s conducted, will often yield results that can happen by chance alone and do not stand up to later scrutiny.\nBut these trials can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct and analyze. Between that and a shortage of FDA reviewers, new treatments for AIDS were flowing through the chronically underfunded agency at the speed of chilled molasses. It took an average of seven to twelve years to take a drug through the development pipeline, three of which could be taken up while a company’s data sat on an FDA reviewer’s desk.\nUnder pressure from patient groups and drugmakers, the FDA created an “accelerated pathway” in 1992, which allowed companies to provide preliminary evidence that their AIDS drugs were effective. The new rules let these companies conduct trials tracking unreliable patient outcomes known as “surrogates,” with the expectation that drugmakers would provide more substantive evidence of real patient benefit after the drugs were on the market.\nSurrogate outcomes are laboratory tests, or imaging studies like CT scans, that don’t themselves track quality or quantity of life, but are hypothesized to be reasonably likely to predict a so-called “clinical benefit.” Clinical outcomes are the ones that matter to patients, like feeling better and living longer, but relying on surrogate outcomes means that drug companies could gain approval based on shorter and cheaper studies.\nThe problem is that improvements in a surrogate outcome often fail to correlate with whether a drug actually improves patients’ lives. In addition, a surrogate outcome can’t reflect the harm that a drug can cause, a limitation that has been repeatedly confirmed.\nSome external experts therefore expressed concern about approving drugs based on surrogate outcomes — and those worries were borne out by the AIDS drug AZT.\nWhen AZT was approved in 1987, many expected it to be a raging success based on research that counted T-cells, disease-fighting cells that the AIDS virus attacks, and other studies that tracked early survival data. But less than two years later, researchers at the Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris published their findings on 365 AIDS patients treated with AZT, concluding the results were “disappointing.” The drug was toxic to blood cells, and after six months, patients “returned to their pretreatment levels [of T-cells] and several opportunistic infections, malignancies, and deaths occurred.’’ (AZT would prove beneficial in later years when used in lower doses as part of a triple cocktail of AIDS drugs.)\nStill, the pharmaceutical industry actively promoted the treatment. With a list price of $21,000 a year per patient in 2025 dollars, AZT delivered $2 billion in profits to its drugmaker Burroughs Wellcome in 1989. Seeing the rewards to be reaped, companies began lobbying Congress to force the FDA to apply the looser AIDS standards to all sorts of drugs.\nBig Pharma’s campaign contributions jumped from $1.9 million in 1990 to $3.6 million in 1992, according to the Federal Election Committee and OpenSecrets, an independent research group. That year, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which explicitly directed the FDA to allow approvals based on lower standards.\nRep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) slammed the legislation, saying that while it “sounds good… it is a hoax to imply that it will do more than the FDA is already doing to bring effective AIDS drugs to the market.”\nThe act also required drug companies to pay “user fees,” which the agency used to hire nearly 600 new staff. But critics say such fees have led some senior agency officials to view the industry as “partners.” The agency would go on to launch multiple “public-private partnerships” with the companies it is tasked with regulating.\nSubsequent laws directed the FDA to expedite drug approvals by further lowering standards of evidence.\n“We opened Pandora’s Box, and Pharma exploited it,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. In 1993, he told an FDA advisory committee that with the best of intentions, and in the face of a terrifying health crisis, AIDS activists had helped “unleash drugs with well-documented toxicities onto the market, without obtaining rigorous data on their clinical efficacy.”\nThe result, said Gonsalves, is “we’ve arrived in hell.”\nThe Missing Evidence\nToday, hundreds of drugs intended to treat a wide range of diseases have been approved by the FDA without critical evidence demonstrating they work.\nAccording to the database created for this investigation, nearly three-quarters — 311 — of the 429 drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were put on the market despite inadequate evidence of their efficacy.\nThis analysis was based on the four essential criteria cited in the FDA’s own standards and case law for assessing whether drugs work and are safe:\n- Control group: Patients taking the drug were compared to a control group that was given a placebo or a comparator drug.\n- Replication: At least two “well-controlled” trials showed the drug was effective.\n- Blinding: Subjects in the studies and the doctors who cared for them don’t know which patients are on the drug and which are in the control group.\n- Clinical endpoint: The studies measured the drug’s effect on patients’ survival or function rather than a surrogate measure.\nThese criteria are by no means a complete list of sound scientific evidence. Instead, they comprise the minimum criteria needed to determine whether drugmakers have provided “substantial evidence” to support claims of effectiveness for new drugs.\nYet only 118 of the 429 drugs approved over that period, a mere 28 percent, met the four criteria. One hundred and twenty-three drugs (29 percent) met three of the criteria, while 39 drugs, more than 9 percent of the total, failed to meet a single criterion. That doesn’t mean these drugs don’t work, but it does mean the FDA approved them without knowing whether they are more likely to help patients than hurt them.\nMore than a quarter of the drugs approved over the study period, 123, were for various forms of cancer. This might seem like good news for the war on cancer, but only three of those drugs met all four of the minimum criteria, and 29 cancer drugs failed to meet a single criterion. In other words, one in four cancer drugs were approved based on studies with no comparison group, no blinding, no replication, and no clinical outcome.\nThe most common way drug companies get such cancer drugs approved is by using a surrogate outcome in their clinical trials, rather than measuring actual clinical benefit. Drug companies routinely study laboratory measures like how much a tumor shrinks in response to a drug, instead of mortality or symptom relief.\nBut experts say the FDA should have no illusions regarding the unreliability of such surrogate outcomes, especially since these outcomes fail to take into account the harms a drug may cause, such as liver failure and anemia. These criticisms were hammered home after the agency approved Avastin to treat metastatic breast cancer.\nOriginally approved for two other types of cancers, Avastin hit the market for breast cancer in 2008. At that time, women with metastatic breast cancer faced a dire prognosis: Most would be dead within five years, even after multiple rounds of chemotherapy drugs. Avastin was hailed as a breakthrough because it doesn’t kill cancer cells the way chemotherapy does but instead inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which tumors need to grow.\nAvastin was approved based on a surrogate outcome called “progression-free survival,” which doesn’t actually look at patient survival but instead measures how long a cancer drug keeps a tumor in check. But just because a tumor isn’t growing or even shrinks doesn’t mean the patient will live longer or enjoy a better quality of life.\nIn 2010, worldwide Avastin sales had hit $6.8 billion. The approval for breast cancer had come with the condition that the manufacturer, Genentech, conduct another study to determine whether the drug actually worked. Two years later, the company produced two studies that suggested the opposite: the drug did not help people live longer.\nIn total, the company had conducted five clinical trials, none of which demonstrated that Avastin helped breast cancer patients live longer or with less disability. The new studies also documented the drug’s more serious side effects, which included blood clots, perforated intestines, stroke, heart problems, and kidney malfunction. Genentech did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nBut when the FDA proposed withdrawing approval for Avastin for breast cancer, Genentech and several patient advocacy groups fought back, sometimes viciously. At a two-day public hearing in 2011, one of the few patient advocates testifying in favor of the FDA’s decision came with a bodyguard after being threatened verbally by others who supported Avastin. FDA staff received violent threats, and police were posted outside the building.\nThe FDA ultimately withdrew its approval of Avastin for breast cancer, but the episode, still referred to as “Armageddon” by some staff, had a chilling effect. The agency would not demand another drug withdrawal in the face of company opposition for more than two decades.\nToday, progression-free survival, along with a half-dozen other surrogate outcomes, has become the norm for approving cancer drugs. This investigation found that 81 percent of the 123 cancer drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were based on studies that did not track overall survival and instead reported on progression-free survival or another surrogate.\nSuch approvals have real consequences for patients. Take Copiktra, a cancer drug manufactured by Secura Bio Inc. that was approved by the FDA in 2018 based on improved progression-free survival and other surrogate outcomes. According to a Lever review of FDA records, two-thirds of leukemia and lymphoma patients taking the drug developed serious complications. Patients treated with Copiktra also died 11 months earlier than patients treated with the comparator drug.\nIn December 2021, the manufacturer announced it would stop marketing the drug for follicular lymphoma. Six months later, the FDA issued a warning about “possible increased risk of death and serious side effects.” But it wasn’t until July 2024 — six years after studies showed the drug cut months off the lives of patients — that the FDA announced that Copitra should not be used as first- or second-line treatment for certain types of leukemia and lymphoma “due to an increased risk of treatment-related mortality.”\nA spokesperson for Copiktra’s manufacturer, Secura Bio, told The Lever that in May 2022, the company sent a “Dear Healthcare Professional” letter to physicians about the results of the post-market studies “in accordance with FDA requirements.” The company said Copiktra can still be prescribed for certain conditions if two other drug treatments have failed.\nCopiktra is hardly an exception. According to a 2015 study, only 14 percent of cancer drugs approved based on a surrogate outcome, such as progression-free survival, between 2008 and 2012 were later shown to improve real-world survival. In other words, 86 percent were not supported by evidence that they helped patients live longer. What the drugs did cause were numerous serious side effects, while costing patients, taxpayers, and insurers billions of dollars a year.\nAnother, more recent study found that between January 2006 and December 2023, 147 cancer drugs that had been approved on a surrogate outcome were later tested to determine if they improved overall survival. Approximately three-quarters failed to do so.\nEven when cancer drugs do improve survival, the gains can be meager. A 2022 study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that the median survival time for 124 cancer medicines approved from 2003 through 2021 to treat solid tumors was just 2.8 months. The average cost of such drugs is more than $24,000 per month.\nIn other words, after patients and their families spend financially crippling sums and go through side effects ranging from nausea to death, their outcomes are hardly better — and could be worse — than no treatment at all.\nThat outcome is not what most cancer patients expect when their doctor writes a prescription. It’s also at odds with what doctors believe about the meaning of FDA drug approvals. In 2016, researchers published the results of a survey sent to physicians that included the following question: “For [the] FDA to approve a drug, must the studies show: a.) a clinically important result; b.) a statistically significant result; c.) both; d.) None of the above.” The correct answer was none of the above.\nOnly 6 percent of doctors got the answer right. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the report, said the result was “disappointing, but not entirely surprising. Doctors aren’t taught about the approval process.”\nWhen the Science Never Comes\nNothing about ProAmatine would suggest it would ever get on the market.\nThis investigation found that between 1990 and 1996, the FDA rejected the blood pressure drug four times. The agency told the company, Roberts Pharmaceutical, that its studies showing ProAmatine could treat low blood pressure when a patient stands up were “poorly conducted.” Nor were the “incremental” increases in blood pressure sufficient proof of benefit since they were surrogate measures, according to the agency, which wanted evidence that patients would feel or function better. The agency instructed the company to conduct randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\nBefore the agency rejected the drug for the fourth time, in March 1996, FDA medical reviewer Maryann Gordon noted a striking incidence of severe high blood pressure among treated patients. She suggested that this side effect might account for at least some of the strokes, heart attacks, and congestive heart failure that had occurred among patients on ProAmatine. She concluded, “…the mostly unexplored benefits of midodrine do not outweigh its real risks, thus making midodrine [ProAmatine] not approvable.”\nBut less than three months after the FDA’s fourth rejection of ProAmatine, the agency reversed course, saying that following a meeting with the company, it had “reconsidered” its prior rejection and would approve ProAmatine after all, under “21 Code of Federal Regulations Subpart H,” a provision in the regulations that the FDA interprets as giving the agency “flexibility” in its approval decisions.\nOne FDA insider who asked to remain anonymous told The Lever, “Subpart H was never meant to rescue failed drug development programs after trials had already failed to show direct benefit to patients.” Instead, the provision was designed to allow the agency leeway in approving drugs that looked highly promising for life-threatening conditions for which there were few or no other treatments.\nWhile the condition treated by ProAmatine is not life-threatening, Roberts Pharmaceutical was able to use the regulation to get the drug on the market in 1996, agreeing to submit a follow-up study no later than 2000 to determine if the drug worked.\nThe year 2000 came and went. No study. In 2003, the drug patent expired. Still no study. The FDA tried to induce the company to conduct the promised post-market study by granting a three-year patent exclusivity extension, allowing the company to maintain a monopoly on the drug and keep its prices high. In 2005, the company submitted two studies, but the FDA found them insufficient.\nIn 2013, researchers at the Mayo Clinic conducted a comprehensive review of all studies of the drug and found ProAmatine provided “no significant benefit” in blood pressure change on standing up. The drug also caused a higher incidence of adverse events, and the researchers concluded “there is insufficient and low-quality evidence” to support its use.\nYet, the drug was allowed to remain on the market with no caution issued to patients or doctors until 2017. As of 2009, it had generated $257 million in sales; in 2023, the midodrine market was estimated to be $745 million. Twenty-nine years after the drug was approved, there is still no evidence that it works. The drug is no longer made by Roberts, and three generic manufacturers who make it did not respond to requests for comment.\n“I think rightly or wrongly, FDA managers have decided that completely bending their standards could still lead to good drugs,” says Matthew Herder, a legal scholar at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Canada. “They put a lot of faith in post-market evidence.” But the history of ProAmatine demonstrates that once a drug has been approved on an expedited basis, a requirement for post-market evidence can have little meaning.\nAccording to a 2022 analysis by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, more than one-third of drugs approved on an accelerated pathway have never seen a confirmatory trial. When they did conduct the studies, regulators found companies took anywhere from a few months to 12 years to do so. This investigation found that confirmatory trials can take even longer — up to 30 years — and may not be performed at all.\nProAmatine, no longer sold under its brand name, is currently manufactured by multiple companies under the generic name midodrine. Three generic manufacturers of midodrine failed to respond to requests for comment.\nEven when post-market studies are submitted, they often provide no new information. Bishal Gyawali, an oncologist and associate professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada, and two Harvard colleagues looked at cancer drugs approved based on surrogate outcomes between December 1992 and May 2017. Twenty percent of the time, the company submitted a follow-up study that looked at the same surrogate it used to get the drug approved — even though the point of the additional study was to determine whether the drug offered an actual clinical benefit. In another 21 percent, the follow-up trial used a different surrogate endpoint, rather than clinical outcomes.\nSuch scenarios are so common that the agency has created a term, “dangling approvals,” for the status of drugs whose post-market trials failed or weren’t conducted before their deadline. As of 2021, the FDA had allowed 10 of 35 cancer treatments to remain on the market even after their follow-up studies failed. The manufacturers eventually withdrew eight of the 10 treatments, but only after patients received ineffective treatments for years and companies reaped healthy financial rewards.\nAmong the drugs with dangling approvals was one that had generated controversy before: Avastin, the failed breast cancer drug. Avastin has been shown to improve survival for some cancers, and in 2009, the FDA authorized the drug for recurrent glioblastoma, a fatal brain cancer, based on progression-free survival. In 2017, after the requisite “confirmatory” trials, the agency granted it full approval — even though the follow-up studies failed to show it helped patients live any longer.\nAvastin remains on the market for recurrent glioblastoma — at a cost of $153,000 per year. European regulators refused to approve the drug for that use, citing concerns about safety and efficacy. A spokesperson for Genentech said some patients could benefit, noting that eleven percent of patients were able to discontinue treatment with steroids.\nThen there’s Keytruda, which is widely advertised on TV for a number of cancers. Granted expedited approval in 2017 to treat a certain type of gastric cancer, the drug subsequently failed its post-market study. Keytruda was sold for this use for nearly four years before regulators withdrew its approval in 2021. It remains on the market for other cancers. Merck did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhile drug companies profit from the sales of unproven drugs, everyone else — patients, insurers, and the government — pays a heavy price. In just four years, from 2018 through 2021, the taxpayer-funded health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid shelled out $18 billion for drugs approved on the condition that their manufacturers produce confirmatory trials that had yet to be delivered.\n“Everybody from the [FDA] commissioner on down keeps telling us that approving these marginal drugs will lead to an accumulation of benefits to patients over time, but if a drug doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, and putting them all together doesn’t add up to an effective treatment,” says Fran Visco, a breast cancer survivor and president and cofounder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. “The entire medical oncology treatment world is built on a shaky foundation of limited evidence and uncertain patient benefit, but rather than admit that, we keep tweaking it and building on top of it. And it’s not just that you are giving people things that don’t work, these drugs will harm them, and they are financially toxic.”\nA Treatment World Built On Nothing\nIn defending dangling approvals, Richard Pazdur, a physician and the head of the cancer drug division at the FDA, wrote in 2021 that when a drug fails in a clinical trial, it “does not necessarily mean that the drug is ineffective.” In one sense, Pazdur is right. Not having convincing evidence that a drug works is not the same as knowing it does not work.\nWhat the scenario does mean is no one knows if it works or not.This investigation’s database shows that hundreds of drugs are now being put on the market before anybody knows if they’re effective.\nIn the past, having a promising surrogate endpoint was used by drug companies to decide whether proceeding to a clinical trial was worth the investment. Now, drugs are put on the market, sold to thousands if not millions of patients, and the evidence to determine if they actually work is allowed to come later, if it comes at all.\nThe arrangement can have devastating costs for people like Laura MacMillan.\nStarting in 2001, Laura MacMillan was diagnosed with a series of puzzling medical conditions. First came interstitial cystitis. Two years later, when she was only 45, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea that was diagnosed as colitis. “I could barely leave my house,” she says. “I had frequent accidents and could only go to stores where I knew there was a bathroom.”\nTwelve years later, she began to see wavy lines as her vision progressively dimmed. One evening, she drove over a cement island in a parking lot, leaving her with a flat tire and $4,700 of damage to her car. Her ophthalmologist could find no known diagnosis for her eye condition and could offer no treatment. Between the colitis and progressing blindness, MacMillan’s world was closing in.\nFinally, in 2021, MacMillan came across Nieraj Jain’s troubling findings of blindness linked to the interstitial cystitis drug Elmiron and instantly put two and two together. She had been on Elmiron for 20 years and had experienced the same retinal changes Jain uncovered. She stopped the drug and within weeks, her colitis symptoms went away. A subsequent colonoscopy showed her gut had completely healed, but MacMillan’s vision loss is permanent.\n“I can’t drive anymore,” she says. “I had to stop working 13 years ago. When I get up in the morning, it can take about two hours for the blurriness to subside enough for me to see words on my tablet. Last summer, my husband and I drove [1,000 miles] to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play the Yankees. Even though we had good seats, I couldn’t see a damn thing. So we won’t ever be able to do that again.”\nMacMillan is relatively lucky compared to the hundreds of others uncovered by this investigation who suffered serious injuries or died while taking the drug.\nThe FDA continues to approve medicines based on evidence as flimsy, contradictory, and inadequate as the data for Elmiron. Citing the need for “flexibility” and the importance of encouraging drug development when there are few treatment options, the agency has all but abandoned its hard-won standards for sound science, according to numerous experts.\nJerome Hoffman, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the lead analyst of the database created for this investigation, says, “Most of us imagine that the primary goal of the FDA is to make sure that the drugs it approves are more likely to help people than to harm them. If so, the FDA would require drugmakers to submit rigorous studies. Instead, the agency seems to have forgotten about that goal and is more interested in promoting the interests of industry than protecting the public health.”\nIn 2014, the Elmiron Study Group published their results of the long-awaited clinical trial that showed Elmiron was no better than a placebo. “I thought that the next day it would be over for Elmiron,” says Curtis Nickel, a urologist at Kingston Hospital in Ontario, Canada, who led the study group. “Doctors would stop prescribing it. The FDA would order it off the market.” But none of that happened.\nInstead, after 24 years, Elmiron is still being sold, and doctors continue to prescribe it. Hundreds of thousands of patients have been exposed to the drug, and the American Urological Association lists it as the only FDA-approved medication for interstitial cystitis. The agency finally added a warning to the drug label in 2020, alerting doctors and patients to the risk of vision loss.\nNowhere is there any mention that studies have never shown Elmiron is effective.\nKeep the press free.

            "Who should be taking weight-loss drugs? Doctors share best candidates. Weight-loss drugs continue to grow in popularity, with market researchers predicting that global demand for the medications could reach $150 billion by 2035.\nGLP-1 agonists — including semaglutides like Ozempic and Wegovy and tirzepatides like Mounjaro and Zepbound — are intended to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nRecent studies, however, have linked these medications to additional benefits, such as a reduction in heart disease and dementia risk, as doctors recommend them to a growing number of patients.\nSCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT\nEven so, recent Yale research found that only 3% of eligible adults received a prescription.\nWho should take weight-loss drugs?\nMost adults who have obesity are good candidates for these medications, according to Dr. John Anderson, an internal medicine physician and diabetes specialist at the Frist Clinic in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"However, the most important group that we really want to address are the patients who have obesity alongside other comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea and significant osteoarthritis,\" Anderson, who is also a board member of the Diabetes Leadership Council, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Anyone who wants to lose weight who is obese is a good candidate, but from a medical standpoint, we're most concerned about this higher-risk patient population.\"\nSTUDY DIRECTLY COMPARES ZEPBOUND AND WEGOVY FOR WEIGHT-LOSS RESULTS\nTo qualify for a weight-loss drug, the patient should first work with a physician to make lifestyle changes in the areas of diet, exercise, sleep and stress management, according to Dr. Michael Aziz, a board-certified internist and regenerative medicine specialist based in New York City.\n\"A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of vegetables and low-sugar fruits should be the first step in weight loss,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"But some people, despite their best efforts, can't lose weight. This could be related to injuries that prevent them from working out or a slow metabolism.\"\n\"By treating obesity earlier, we can prevent disease progression.\"\nInsurance pays for weight-loss medications if the patient's body mass index is over 27, according to Aziz.\n(Patients are considered overweight if they have a BMI of 25 to 29.9, and are considered obese if the number is greater than 30, according to the National Institutes of Health.)\nBeyond the high-risk groups, Anderson said he’d like to see these medications made \"available and affordable\" for a vast majority of patients impacted by obesity.\n\"By treating obesity earlier, we can prevent disease progression,\" he said. \"GLP-1s have been shown to reduce progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes by 94%, and significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events.\"\nHe added, \"Obesity is connected to 200 comorbidities, including heart disease, kidney disease and 40% of all cancers, which is why addressing the disease early is key.\"\nDOCTORS WARN OF 'TRIFECTA' OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES PLAGUING AMERICANS AFTER MAHA REPORT\nPatients don’t have to be diabetic to benefit from GLP-1 medications for weight loss, according to Dr. Wiljon Beltre, a board-certified bariatric and metabolic surgeon and the founder of Beltre Bariatrics in Orlando, Florida.\n\"I also agree that patients with lower levels of obesity (BMI lower than 30) can derive great benefits from these medications,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"These patients can turn out to be excellent candidates for GLP-1s, since they seem to lose weight faster and notice a change almost immediately.\"\nBenefits beyond obesity and diabetes\nSeveral ongoing studies are exploring the use of weight-loss medications to treat a range of conditions, including alcoholism and addiction, Alzheimer’s and dementia, liver disease, and more, according to Anderson.\n\"The way these medications work is by slowing stomach emptying so that you feel fuller longer, but they also have feedback to the appetite center of hypothalamus in the brain, which turns off the food noise,\" he said.\n\"Experts across the country are finding that it also seems to reduce cravings for alcohol in patients — that their reward center is turning off the desire for alcohol.\"\nMore research is needed to confirm this effect, but Anderson said these drugs could potentially be \"life-changing\" for those battling addiction.\nWEIGHT-LOSS MEDICATIONS MAY ALSO BENEFIT COMMON MEDICAL PROBLEM, STUDY FINDS\nAziz noted that GLP-1 drugs have also been shown to reduce the risk of both heart attacks and stroke by 20%.\n\"They also help to reverse a fatty liver and improve sleep apnea,\" he added.\nRisks and limitations\nDiabetes and obesity medications are widely known to cause gastrointestinal issues in some patients — primarily nausea, with some reporting vomiting, constipation and diarrhea.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Most of those occur when doing dose escalation, and the vast majority are able to get through that,\" Anderson said. \"This typically occurs early in therapy and tapers off over time.\"\nPatients with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer or pancreatitis should avoid these medications, according to experts. Pregnant women are also advised against taking them.\nSome patients have also reported a loss of muscle mass, hair thinning or shedding, mood changes and other unwanted outcomes.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"People should understand that GLP-1 is not a magic solution to weight loss, but one leg of a three-legged stool — it needs to be combined with healthy eating habits and exercise,\" said Beltre.\nIt’s also important for patients to understand that they cannot take these medications forever, the doctor noted.\n\"People should understand that GLP-1 is not a magic solution to weight loss, but one leg of a three-legged stool.\"\nMany doctors, however, report that the benefits outweigh the potential side effects.\n\"Importantly, I’m seeing many patients now able to participate in activities for the first time in many years following significant weight loss — ice skating, going on walks, canceling knee replacements and dropping blood pressure medications,\" Anderson noted.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nThose interested in weight-loss medications should consult with a physician to explore potential benefits and risks."

Asian shares are mixed and oil prices rise as escalating Iran-Israel crisis hits Wall Street\nAsian shares are mixed and oil prices have advanced after the escalation of conflict in the Middle East hit Wall Street\nHONG KONG -- Asian shares were mixed and oil prices advanced Wednesday after the escalation of conflict in the Middle East hit Wall Street.\nU.S. benchmark crude oil was up 24 cents at $73.51 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 28 cents at $76.71 per barrel. Crude prices rose more than 4% on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump left a Group of Seven summit in Canada early and warned that people in Iran’s capital should evacuate immediately. Within about eight hours, Trump went from suggesting a nuclear deal with Iran remained “achievable” to urging Tehran’s 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives.\nThe fighting has driven prices for crude oil and gasoline higher because Iran is a major oil exporter and it sits on the narrow Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s crude passes. Past conflicts in the area have caused spikes in oil prices, though they’ve historically proven brief after showing that they did not disrupt the flow of oil.\nJapan reported that its exports fell in May as the auto industry was hit by Trump's higher tariffs, with exports to the U.S. falling more than 11%. But Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 0.7% to 38,803.10.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.2% to 23,695.62 while the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.2% to 3,380.47.\nThe Kospi in Seoul gained 0.6% to 2,967.89 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 8,528.50.\nOn Tuesday, U.S. stocks slumped under the weight of higher oil prices and weaker than expected retail sales in May.\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 5,982.72 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7% to 42,215.80. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9% to 19,521.09.\nTrump raised the temperature on Israel’s fight with Iran by calling for “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” on his social media platform and saying, “We are not going to” kill Iran’s leader, “at least for now.”\nPricier oil can help stocks of companies in the solar industry because they increase the incentive to switch to alternative energy sources. But solar stocks tumbled Tuesday on the possibility that Congress may phase out tax credits for solar, wind and other energy sources that produce fewer emissions that change the Earth’s climate.\nEnphase Energy dropped 24%, and First Solar fell 17.9%.\nTreasury yields fell after a report said shoppers spent less last month at U.S. retailers than the month before. Solid spending has been one of the linchpins keeping the economy out of a recession, but part of May’s drop may have simply been a return to more normal trends.\nIn April, some shoppers had rushed to buy automobiles to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs.\nVerve Therapeutics soared 81.5% after Eli Lilly said it would buy the company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease in a $1 billion deal that could be worth up to $1.3 billion if certain conditions are met. Lilly’s stock fell 2%.\nAll the action took place as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rates. The nearly unanimous expectation among traders and economists is that the Fed will make no move.\nThe Fed has hesitated to lower interest rates, and it’s been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it’s waiting to see how much Trump’s tariffs will hurt the economy and raise inflation. Inflation has remained relatively tame recently, and it’s near the Fed’s target of 2%.\nIn currency trading early Wednesday, the U.S. dollar fell to 145.09 Japanese yen from 145.29 yen. The euro edged higher, to $1.1498 from $1.1480.",
            "'The White House should be worried': Oil prices soar after Israel's attack on Iran. ‘The White House should be worried': Oil prices soar after Israel’s attack on Iran\nNo matter how the fighting unfolds, it promises to increase prices at the gasoline pump just as voters’ natural gas and electricity bills are already set to rise.\nIsrael’s attack on Iran has President Donald Trump facing the prospect of the same economic nightmare that helped unravel Joe Biden’s presidency — rapidly spiking energy prices triggered by a war outside his control.\nThe series of airstrikes that began Thursday night caused the world benchmark oil price to jump to $73 a barrel as of noon Eastern time Friday, up $8 since early Wednesday, with the promise of more price hikes to come if the fighting spreads. Energy analysts said the price could shoot to $100 a barrel — a level not seen since the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — if the conflict widens and interrupts oil shipments from the Middle East.\nNo matter how the fighting unfolds, it promises to increase prices at American gasoline pumps just as voters’ natural gas and electricity bills are already set to rise. And it comes at a time when Trump may have fewer tools at his disposal than Biden did to blunt their impact.\nGasoline prices could jump as much as 25 cents a gallon in the coming weeks because of the fighting, predicted Patrick De Haan, a gasoline market analyst at the pricing website GasBuddy.com. Regular gasoline prices averaged $3.13 a gallon Friday.\nTrump, who campaigned heavily last year on cutting energy prices, has started complaining publicly about the global markets not comporting with his priorities.\nDuring a bill signing ceremony Wednesday, Trump chided Energy Secretary Chris Wright over this week’s rise in oil prices, which had begun climbing amid news of a possibly imminent Israeli attack. “I was going to call and really start screaming at you,” Trump told Wright.\nEvery White House knows that presidents of either party suffer when higher gasoline prices beset voters. And Trump could be particularly vulnerable if a significant rise in fuel prices triggers the sort of economic slowdown that analysts have warned his tariffs could bring.\n“Geopolitical price spikes pose a bigger risk of recession than inflation in my view,” said Bob McNally, who heads the energy and geopolitical analysis firm Rapidan Energy and served on the National Security Council and National Economic Council during the George W. Bush administration. “The White House should be worried.”\nTrump still has headroom for any rise in pump prices resulting from the Israel attack. Friday’s average gasoline price was down 33 cents from a year ago and $1.88 from their all-time high in June 2022, according to AAA.\nBut if the fighting spreads, things could get politically hot for Trump quickly. If Israel targets Iran’s oil fields or export facilities, prices could rise another $7.50 a barrel, said Andy Lipow, head of the market analysis firm Lipow Oil Associates. If Iran then attacks the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf — a major waterway for oil exports out of the Middle East — “we could see $100 oil,” Lipow said.\n“Iran knows full well that President Trump is focused on lower energy prices,” Lipow said in an email. “Actions by Iran that impact Middle Eastern oil supplies raising gasoline and diesel prices for Americans are politically damaging to the president.”\nWorryingly for the White House, Trump can do little to tamp down prices. The president’s only real option include using his bully pulpit and diplomats to try to persuade Israel and Iran to quell the fighting soon.\nHe could also tell Wright to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, hoping that unleashing a gusher of crude into the global markets will keep the price under control. Biden took that step in a big way after Russia’s Ukraine invasion, selling off more than 40 percent of the stockpile in a move that Republicans blasted as a politically minded misuse of a reserve meant for national emergencies.\nBut the reserve is still considerably smaller than it was pre-Biden, leaving Trump with less oil to release without depleting it. The reserve had 402 million barrels as of last week, down from 626 million barrels four years ago.\nA DOE spokesperson maintained that the administration was lowering prices by cutting regulations. “While oil prices are dictated by supply and demand, the Trump administration is reducing regulatory costs and removing red tape holding back energy production, delivering lower energy costs for the American people,” Andrea Woods said in an email.\nBefore this week, oil prices had fallen nearly $20 a barrel below where they were when Trump reentered the White House Jan. 20 — though the biggest drop came after Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in early April, which triggered fears of a worldwide economic slowdown and threw energy demand into doubt. The oil producing countries in OPEC also boosted their own output earlier this year, further lessening prices — until now.\nAt the moment, the hike in oil prices seems to have stalled, said Tamas Varga, an analyst at the brokerage firm PVM Oil Associates, and they could come back down if the fighting settles.\n“Given that the situation is fluid it would not be surprising to see prices remain stable ahead of the weekend,” Varga said in an email. “Next Monday, however, there is a chance of a significant retracement provided the situation is contained. If there is no tangible supply shock, the current rally will not be maintained.”\nThe low prices the White House started with may help blunt voter’s anger at rising prices, said Kevin Book, director at analyst firm ClearView Energy. But that doesn’t mean Trump can be complacent, given his campaign promises.\n“Politically, that offers Trump some headroom,” Book said. “But, of course, Trump didn’t campaign on keeping energy costs the same. He campaigned on bringing them down.”",
            "The Saudis are hurting the US oil industry. Trump’s unlikely to talk about it.. The Saudis are hurting the US oil industry. Trump’s unlikely to talk about it.\nThe oil issue? “It’s secondary,” says one expert, as the president prepares for talks in the Middle East.\nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign promise of U.S. “energy dominance” is running into a flood of OPEC crude oil — a surge of fuel production pushed by the Saudi leaders greeting him during his Mideast trip this week.\nBut don’t expect Trump to complain about the cartel’s plan to raise output by nearly a million barrels per day in June, according to three people familiar with the trip who were granted anonymity to describe private discussions.\nThe planned production surge has contributed to a sharp drop in oil prices this year, bringing economic pain to U.S. petroleum companies and undermining Trump’s pledges of a huge increase in American energy production. But it also makes it easier for Trump to fulfill a second crucial but contradictory promise — big cuts in energy prices for the inflation-weary voters who helped return him to the White House.\nThe dynamic is yet another example of how external forces, including the Saudis’ commanding role in the world’s oil markets, continue to complicate Trump’s frequent calls for a new American “golden age.”\nTrump’s current stance on energy appears to confirm what U.S. oil executives have been fearing: If caught between higher production and low prices, he’ll pick the latter, said Bob McNally, founder and president of the consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush.\n“If there was any confusion as to which he prefers, there’s none any more,” McNally said.\nInstead of cajoling Saudi Arabia into easing off plans to produce more oil, the main topics of Trump’s visit will be ongoing tensions in the Middle East – including U.S. negotiations with Iran – as well as a potential arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the United States, the three people said. The Trump administration may also ask for Gulf states to invest in the U.S., the people said.\n“The goal here is for everyone to build bridges,” said one person familiar with the trip planning who was granted anonymity to discuss planning. “With the oil issue, it’s secondary.”\nThe White House did not respond to questions about whether OPEC’s decision to increase output will be a topic during Trump’s Middle East meetings or whether the president was concerned about how low prices were affecting the U.S. oil industry.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has its own reasons for wanting higher oil production: it wants to regain market share after years of ceding it to rivals, even though the move will cause it short-term fiscal pain. News last month of the impending OPEC gusher pushed oil prices to their lowest levels in more than four years, with the benchmark U.S. price sinking below $55 per barrel briefly, down from more than $80 a year earlier.\nThe price was $61 on Friday, compared with $77 when Trump took office.\nU.S. oil companies are now cutting their spending on new wells after two consecutive years of record-setting production during the Biden era, and analysts are rolling back their previous forecasts for production increases.\nWith the market beset by OPEC’s supply increase and the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration’s trade war, U.S. oil production could actually decline in 2026, the first such drop since the Covid-19 pandemic caused a dramatic decline of global fuel demand, analyst firm S&P Global Commodity Insights said in a report.\nA drop caused by policy changes in the United States and Saudi Arabia would be a huge reversal for an industry that has been notching up record-high volumes almost continually since the fracking boom took hold in 2008.\n“Although the magnitude of a potential economic and oil demand downturn is as uncertain as the future course of U.S. tariffs, the impact will be negative,” Jim Burkhard, S&P’s global head of crude oil research, said in a statement announcing the report. “Initial warning signs of a potential downturn are only starting to come into view. The level of severity is now the big question.”\nDuring the campaign, Trump frequently preached the clashing policy goals of cheap energy prices and sharply higher U.S. oil output as a core tenet of his “energy dominance” agenda. That policy includes tapping reservoirs in protected areas such as Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, increasing lease sales on federal land and water, and speeding the issuance of drilling permits.\nThe oil and gas industry contributed an estimated $75 million to his campaign, despite some executives’ misgivings about a return of the trade chaos that raised energy companies’ prices and roiled their international markets during his first term. That amount was far less than the $1 billion that Trump had suggested during a meeting with oil executives a year ago at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and even less than what Tesla CEO Elon Musk personally spent on the president’s behalf.\nTrump has hailed the fall in domestic gasoline prices — even exaggerating how much it’s dropped — as relief for consumers who had to pay a record-high national average of $5 per gallon nearly three years ago during Joe Biden’s presidency. The decline also runs counter to the fears of inflation that have wracked the economy amid Trump’s tariffs war.\nHe’s kept up the praise even as U.S. oil prices hovered near $60 per barrel — a level where industry CEOs say they begin to slow their drills.\n“Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon,” he posted on Truth Social early this month, “lowest in years, groceries (and eggs!) down, energy down, mortgage rates down, employment strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs.”\nHowever, average U.S. gasoline prices at the time were actually closer to $3.16 a gallon, and the widely respected gas-price monitor GasBuddy said none of the more than 100,000 stations it tracks showed a price at the level Trump claimed.\nAnalysts largely interpret OPEC’s bid to hike output as the Saudis reasserting control over rival producers. Those include Kazakhstan, which has collaborated with the cartel under an expanded “OPEC+” umbrella that also includes Russia.\nFor the Trump administration, the bearish pressure on oil prices also helps ease concerns that its recent ratcheting up of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports during negotiations over its nuclear program will tighten market supplies. A drop in Iranian shipments could also pave the way for Saudis to ship more oil to China, which has been the biggest buyer of Iranian crude.\nBut the new glut threatens to capsize the U.S. oil industry, which has parlayed the shale oil revolution into a nearly two-decade boom to become the world’s biggest producer and a top-five exporter.\nU.S. oil production last year hit a record high of 13.4 million barrels a day last year, the highest output of any country in history. Meanwhile, U.S. gas production has risen enough to make the country the largest natural gas exporter in the world, a trade that gives it serious geopolitical clout.\nTrump and Gulf State officials will likely discuss oil market conditions at some point during this week’s trip, even if it isn’t an official topic on the schedule, said Landon Derentz, senior director of the global energy center at the think tank Atlantic Council.\n“It is conceivable that in a desert tent over dinner the two leaders would discuss the direction of global energy affairs,” said Derentz, who was an energy and national security official under the first Trump and Biden administrations. “President Trump’s agenda with Saudi Arabia will likely focus on broader national security and economic priorities, but he has a long history of working with [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman on energy market issues and policy.”\nIn earnings calls, U.S. oil producers have started talking about cutting spending plans for the rest of the year.\nIndependent oil company EOG Resources on May 1 cut its investment plans by $200 million for 2025. Diamondback Energy, another independent oil company, warned that the economic uncertainty unleashed by Trump’s trade war would pull about 10 percent of the drilling rigs operating in the United States out of the field.\n“As a result of these activity cuts, it is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter,” Diamondback Chief Executive Travis Stice said in a letter the company published Monday. “We believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices.”\nOPEC’s contribution to falling oil prices dovetails with Trump’s promise to lower energy costs, said Paul Sankey, lead analyst at commodity firm Sankey Research — unwelcome news for the U.S. oil companies hoping for some sort of relief.\nSaudi government officials ”haven’t said they’re going to crush the U.S. oil and gas industry, but it’s a foregone conclusion,” Sankey said in an interview. Meanwhile, “low oil prices is one of the things [Trump] can point to as a promise delivered.”\nThe problem is that the longer prices stay at current levels, the more the White House is putting at risk an oil industry that propelled the United States to the forefront of global energy markets, Sankey said.\n“One of the great success stories in the United States in the past 15 years is the oil and gas sector transforming the U.S.” from a net energy importer to an exporting giant, Sankey continued. “Making that go away, which is what could happen next, is not going to be a great thing for the U.S.”"

            "White House sends Congress request for $9.4B in DOGE cuts. White House sends Congress request for $9.4B in DOGE cuts\nThe White House on Tuesday sent Congress a request to claw back $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and to public broadcasting — the first package that would codify the slashes spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nIt is a long-awaited move that many conservative activists have been clamoring for, even as House and Senate Republicans separately push forward on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act full of President Trump’s tax cut and spending priorities.\nThe package needs only a simple majority to pass in each chamber, allowing Republicans to bypass the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Congress has 45 days to approve the rescission request after it is submitted — but must balance that timeline with other top priorities like the “big, beautiful bill.”\nThe House is aiming to vote on the package next week.\n“Today, we have officially received the rescissions request from the White House to eliminate $9.4 billion in wasteful foreign aid spending at State and USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said. “The House will act quickly on this request.”\nCommunication from President Trump officially making the request to rescind the funds was read on the House floor Tuesday afternoon.\n“I herewith report 22 rescissions of budget authority totaling $9.4 billion. The proposed rescissions affect programs of the Department of State, as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, United States Agency for International Development, the United States Institute of Peace, and other international assistance programs,” the message from Trump said.\nThe package would rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid, largely from funding that was approved for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which was largely dismantled as part of the DOGE efforts earlier this year.\nAn Office of Management and Budget (OMB) spokesperson pointed to millions of dollars in those accounts that funded global LGBTQ programs and other gender equity programs, as well as global climate change and green energy initiatives.\nIt would also cut almost $9 million from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) — with an OMB spokesperson pointing to how it funded “$3 million for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia” and “$5.1 million to strengthen the ‘resilience of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans gender, intersex, and queer global movements.’” It also rescinds $22 million from the African Development Foundation.\nThe package calls for more than $2 billion in cuts targeting what it described as “unnecessary development assistance,” elimination of funds for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and other programs.\nMore than $1.6 billion would be clawed back from the Economic Support Fund (ESF), if Congress approved the proposal, along with $800 million for the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account at the State Department, which officials note provides funds for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and overseas humanitarian assistance.\nIt also calls for $400 million for global health programs implemented by USAID that funds “activities related to controlling HIV/AIDS.”\n“This proposal would eliminate only those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests,” the request states. “This rescission proposal aligns with the Administration’s efforts to eliminate wasteful foreign assistance programs.”\nRepublicans are heavily messaging on the package’s $1.1 billion in rescissions to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for NPR and PBS — two outlets that Republicans have decried as biased.\nThat includes cutting advanced appropriations approved by Congress for CPB, rescinding $535 million in both fiscal 2026 and 2027 each.\n“These funds would be used to subsidize a public media system that is politically biased and an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer. Enacting the rescission would eliminate Federal funding for CPB,” the request states.\nBoth outlets have sued over Trump orders targeting their funding.\nThe cuts would amount to only a fraction of the estimated $175 billion in “savings” DOGE’s website says it has racked up through a combination of efforts, including workforce reductions, grants and contract cancellations, as well as regulatory savings and asset sales.\nHowever, top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees have accused the Trump administration of illegally freezing $425 billion in federal funding as of Tuesday, as it has undertaken a sweeping operation to shrink the size of the federal government.\nConservatives in both chambers have been confident that the GOP-led Congress will be able to push through the proposed cuts. Some are hopeful the package will be the first of multiple from the White House in the months ahead, particularly as the Trump administration’s downsizing efforts face roadblocks in court.\n“I think we’ll get it done. I really do,” House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told reporters shortly after the request’s release on Tuesday, though he also said there’s “certainly some things” he “would disagree with.”\nHowever, some senators have already signaled changes will likely be made to the request. Other Republicans have also expressed concerns about how funding cuts would impact television stations back home and about the impact of cutting PEPFAR funding.\n“Before I decide on what I’ll agree to, I want to find out what it would do to my Native American populations who use the am radio, I think FM, in some areas, to actually communicate throughout those rural areas,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said Tuesday.\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said in a statement that, despite the “fast track” rescission process, the committee “will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.”\nThe Impoundment Control Act provides the president with a legal pathway to cancel congressionally approved funds. The 1974 law allows the president to temporarily withhold funding after the administration sends its request to Congress. But if Congress fails to greenlight Trump’s proposed rescissions, the administration must release the funding.\nTrump has been the only president to send the special message to Congress in the past two decades in an effort to yank back funds.

            "U.S. House votes to yank billions for NPR, PBS and foreign aid programs. 16:59\nrepublished\nU.S. House votes to yank billions for NPR, PBS and foreign aid programs\nU.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., holds up an Elmo toy while the chamber debates a bill that would eliminate previously approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to public radio and television stations, including the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, which airs “Sesame Street.” (Screen shot taken from House Clerk website livestream.)\nWASHINGTON — The U.S. House narrowly passed legislation Thursday that would revoke $9.4 billion in previously approved funding for public media, including National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as foreign aid, though the bill’s future in the Senate amid a strict timeline is uncertain.\nThe 214-212 mostly party-line vote marks just the third time in several decades the House has approved a bill to claw back funding that lawmakers formerly agreed to spend. President Donald Trump sent the rescissions request that led to the House bill to the Republican-controlled Congress earlier this month.\nRepublican Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio voted against approving the bill along with all of the chamber’s Democrats.\nNebraska Rep. Don Bacon and New York Rep. Nick LaLota, both Republicans, switched from opposing to supporting the bill after Speaker Mike Johnson spoke with them on the floor as the vote was held open.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., contended during floor debate that pulling back the funding is the right place to start, but said the GOP will seek to do much more in the months and years ahead.\nScalise said PBS and NPR should have to compete against other media organizations without grant funding from the federal government.\n“There is still going to be a plethora of options for the American people,” Scalise said. “But if they’re paying their hard-earned dollars to go get content, why should your tax dollars only go to one thing that the other side wants to promote? Let everybody go compete on a fair basis.”\nMaine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said every state in the country would feel the impact of eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n“I rise today in strong opposition to the reckless attack on public media contained within this rescissions bill and millions of Americans who rely on and treasure their local public television and radio stations,” Pingree said.\nEfforts to defund CPB, she said, were the result of Trump’s “agenda against the free press and his authoritarian desire to control the media.”\nPublic media would lose $1.1 billion\nThe seven-page bill would rescind all funding that Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, a total of $1.1 billion.\nCPB, which provides grants to public radio and television stations throughout the country, is one of the few programs that receives an advanced appropriation. So the funding elimination envisioned in the House bill would take effect starting on Oct. 1.\nThe legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nFlorida Republican Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said during an interview Wednesday there were extensive talks between GOP lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget before the Trump administration officially submitted this rescissions request.\nBut Díaz-Balart cautioned there would need to be substantial pre-negotiations ahead of any future rescissions requests for programs within his annual funding bill.\n“This rescission package — which I’ve had communication with OMB on — if this passes, we can move forward,” he said. “Now, if you’re talking about a potential for future additional rescissions, that could potentially create a problem and tie the president’s hands when it comes to dealing with adversaries or helping allies.”\nDíaz-Balart said that OMB officials hoping to make any additional rescissions requests on foreign aid would need to engage in “a level of coordination that is so detailed, so intense to make sure that nothing comes forward that could potentially hurt the president’s ability to really do the America First agenda internationally.”\nFlorida Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, ranking member on the State-Foreign Operations spending panel, said during floor debate Thursday the bill was an attack on American values and posed a threat to national security.\n“It’s not charity, it’s strategy,” Frankel said of foreign aid. “Don’t take my word for it, military leaders from both parties have warned us for years — if we fail to lead with soft power, we’ll end up paying in blood, bombs and more boots on the ground.”\n“Cutting foreign assistance will deepen desperation, fuel extremism, push fragile societies toward collapse and when that happens we all pay the price,” she added. “Refugee crises surge, diseases spread, trade routes shut down, our troops and diplomats face greater danger and our homeland security is weakened.”\nFirst of many requests\nThe House vote took place just one week after the Trump administration sent lawmakers the rescissions request, the first of many proposals the White House budget office plans to submit.\nThe $9.4 billion cancellation proposal represents a small fraction of the roughly $6.8 trillion the federal government spends each year.\nThe recommendation said some of the foreign aid should be cancelled because it supported “programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs.”\nThe rescissions request allows the Office of Management and Budget to legally freeze funding on the programs listed for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve the recommendation as is, amend it, or ignore it.\nThe House and Senate must agree to approve the same rescissions bill before mid-July for the changes to take effect. Failure to reach a bicameral agreement before then would require the Trump administration to spend the funding and block the president from requesting the same cancellation for the rest of his term.\nRescissions requests are rare since Congress typically negotiates spending levels on thousands of federal programs in the dozen annual spending bills that are then signed by the president.\nThe first Trump administration proposed rescissions in 2018, but the bill never made it through the Senate.\nThe last time Congress actually approved rescinding funding was in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\nMore action in the Senate\nThe Senate will need to take up the bill before mid-July if it wants to approve any of the spending cuts, though several GOP senators told States Newsroom during brief interviews Wednesday ahead of the House vote they may amend the package, which would require it to go back to the House for final approval before the 45-day clock runs out.\nRescissions bills come with a vote-a-rama in the Senate, giving Republicans and Democrats the chance to call up as many amendments as they want for a floor vote. The GOP holds a 53-member majority, so four or more Republicans opposing any element of the bill would likely lead to its removal.\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she will give the rescissions bill “careful consideration.”\nIn a statement released earlier this month just after the White House sent the request to lawmakers, Collins wrote the committee would “carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.”\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said he’s mostly supportive of the rescissions request, though he didn’t rule out offering an amendment to restore full funding for the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, often called PEPFAR.\n“I think I’ll be okay with most of it. I’m concerned about PEPFAR. I’ll have to look at that,” Graham said.\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the spending panel that oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said she’s planning to evaluate the bill once it arrives.\n“We’ve got all these other things I’m thinking about. I haven’t even focused on it,” Capito said, referring to ongoing negotiations over the party’s “big, beautiful bill.”\nAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said she’s going to “try to” ensure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting keeps its funding.\n“I’m a supporter of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It’s a lifeline for many of my small, rural communities,” Murkowski said\nKansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior appropriator, said he’s “trying to figure out a strategy of how to deal with” both the foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting provisions once the bill comes over from the House.\n“I’m looking at both of them to see what the right outcome should be.”\n‘The risk of living in a news desert’\nBoth PBS and NPR released statements following the House vote, pledging to do their best to keep their funding intact.\nKatherine Maher, NPR president and CEO, wrote in a statement the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essential to the organization.\n“Americans who rely on local, independent stations serving communities across America, especially in rural and underserved regions, will suffer the immediate consequences of this vote,” Maher wrote. “If rescission passes and local stations go dark, millions of Americans will no longer have access to locally owned, independent, nonprofit media and will bear the risk of living in a news desert, missing their emergency alerts, and hearing silence where classical, jazz and local artists currently play.”\nPaula Kerger, president and CEO at PBS, wrote in a separate statement the “fight to protect public media does not end with this vote, and we will continue to make the case for our essential service in the days and weeks to come.\n“If these cuts are finalized by the Senate, it will have a devastating impact on PBS and local member stations, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets. Without PBS and local member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.”\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "Trump wants Congress to slash $9.4B in spending now, defund NPR and PBS. 13:54\nrepublished\nTrump wants Congress to slash $9.4B in spending now, defund NPR and PBS\nCassidy, Kennedy reviewing presidents’ call to claw back money from public broadcasting\nA sign for the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, is seen on its building headquarters on Feb. 18, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON — The Trump administration sent its first spending cuts request to Congress on Tuesday, asking lawmakers to swiftly eliminate $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.\nThe request for what are called rescissions allows the White House budget office to legally freeze spending on those accounts for 45 days while the Republican-controlled Congress debates whether to approve the recommendation in full or in part, or to ignore it.\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. That means NPR and PBS would lose their already approved federal allocations, if the request is approved by Congress.\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in May seeking to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from providing funding for NPR and PBS, leading to two separate lawsuits citing First Amendment concerns.\nIn the rescissions request, Trump wants to cut $8.3 billion from foreign aid programs, including the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS, and the African Development Foundation.\nThe proposal is the first of several that will seek to codify efforts undertaken by U.S. DOGE Service and billionaire Elon Musk before he left his official role as a special government employee.\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought wrote in a letter accompanying the request that it “emphasizes the need to cut wasteful foreign assistance spending at the Department of State and USAID and through other international assistance programs.”\n“These rescissions would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests, such as funding the World Health Organization, LGBTQI+ activities, ‘equity’ programs, radical Green New Deal-type policies, and color revolutions in hostile places around the world,” Vought wrote. “In addition, Federal spending on CPB subsidizes a public media system that is politically biased and is an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.”\nGOP leaders in Congress appear likely to hold floor votes on the request, which only needs a simple majority to pass the Senate, avoiding the need for Democratic support to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote in a statement the House “will act quickly on this request.”\n“This rescissions package reflects many of DOGE’s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,” Johnson wrote. “Congress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.”\nBut Republican leaders could run into problems with centrist Republicans in each chamber, especially those on the Appropriations committees, which approved the funding in the first place.\nThe GOP holds especially narrow majorities in Congress, requiring the support of nearly every one of the 220 Republicans in the House and the party’s 53 senators.\nRepublican leaders may need to negotiate what exactly gets written into the rescissions bill if too many moderate Republicans raise objections to cutting off the funding.\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote in a statement the committee “will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.”\nForeign aid, public media take hits\nThe request calls for lawmakers to make cuts to dozens of foreign aid programs, including $500 million out of $4 billion for certain global health programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs,” the request states. “This rescission proposal aligns with the Administration’s efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs.”\nThe rescissions request proposes Congress eliminate $400 million of the $6 billion for global health programs that seek to control HIV/AIDS, which OMB writes “would eliminate only those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.”\nThe request asks lawmakers to eliminate $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion they approved for development assistance, which “is intended to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies, but in practice, many of the DA programs conflict with American values, interfere with the sovereignty of other countries, and bankroll corrupt leaders’ evasion of their responsibilities to their citizens, all while providing no clear benefit to Americans.”\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate more than $1 billion in funding across two fiscal years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which the administration wrote “would be used to subsidize a public media system that is politically biased and an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.”\nPresident and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Patricia Harrison wrote in a statement the organization “is firmly committed to ensuring that funding for public media provides local communities with accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news and information, and we take seriously concerns about bias that have been raised.\n“The path to better public media is achievable only if funding is maintained. Otherwise, a vital lifeline that operates reliable emergency communications, supports early learning, and keeps local communities connected and informed will be cut off with regrettable and lasting consequences.”\nPresident and CEO of PBS Paula Kerger wrote in a separate statement that the “proposed rescissions would have a devastating impact on PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets.\n“Without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.”\nKerger wrote that PBS would seek to keep its funding by demonstrating “our value to Congress, as we have over the last 50 years, in providing educational, enriching programs and critical services to all Americans every day for free.”\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher wrote that Congress enacting the rescissions “would irreparably harm communities across America who count on public media for 24/7 news, music, cultural and educational programming, and emergency alerting services.”\n“Public safety in every community across the nation could also be affected. NPR, as the entity chosen by public radio stations to operate the nationwide Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), receives Presidential-level emergency alerts and distributes them across the country within minutes,” Maher wrote. “In the event of a national attack or emergency, communities no longer served by a station would not receive this lifesaving, early warning and civil defense alert.”\nMore details\nA summary of the proposal shared with States Newsroom by the White House budget office ahead of its official release later in the day says the funding cuts would affect programs that sought to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela; support electoral reforms and voter education in Kenya; fund voter identification in Haiti; provide electric buses in Rwanda; broadcast the longtime PBS children’s show “Sesame Street” in Iraq; and strengthen the resilience of LGBTQ global movements.\nThe proposal would also cut off funding to Harvard University to conduct research models for peace and to New York University to analyze democracy field experiments in South Sudan, according to the OMB summary.\nPEPFAR would no longer have funding for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia, or for services for “transgender people, sex workers and their clients and sexual networks” in Nepal, according to the OMB summary.\nLouisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a vocal supporter of PEPFAR, said during a brief interview that he was told “that PEPFAR had some cuts, but that the basic core mission was continued.”\nCassidy — chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — said his staff was carefully reviewing the request and knows he cares “about this deeply.”\nThe rescissions request, which asks lawmakers to claw back already approved funding, is different from the president’s budget request, which proposes spending levels for thousands of federal programs for the upcoming fiscal year.\nBoth are merely proposals, since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.\nTiming on Senate floor vote unclear\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday that lawmakers in that chamber will begin reviewing the rescissions request this month, but didn’t detail exactly when he’d hold a floor vote.\n“Another item high on our list to begin work on in June is a rescissions package the White House intends to send Congress this week,” Thune said. “The administration has identified a number of wasteful uses of taxpayer dollars and we will be taking up this package and eliminating this waste. We’ll make that a priority.”\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Monday that “Trump is looking to go after PBS and NPR to settle political scores and muzzle the free press, while undermining foreign assistance programs that push back on China’s malign influence, save lives, and address other bipartisan priorities.”\n“If Republicans choose to go along with this rescission package, they will follow Trump at their peril,” Schumer and Murray wrote. “The power of the purse is one of Congress’s most fundamental Constitutional responsibilities. Democrats will not allow Republicans to play games with the budget.”\nLouisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said during a brief interview Tuesday that he plans to “carefully” evaluate the rescissions request.\nWest Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday that she would go over the proposals once it officially arrives from the White House to determine whether she can support moving it across the floor.\n“It could be a fight. It could not be a fight,” Capito said. “We just don’t know.”\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members led by Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, posted Monday its members hope the administration sends additional rescissions requests as quickly as possible.\n“Passing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress’s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda,” the Freedom Caucus statement said. “While the Swamp will inevitably attempt to slow and kill these cuts, there is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.”\nLast updated 4:54 p.m., Jun. 3, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "GOP megabill could undermine US energy production, Republicans warn. GOP megabill could undermine US energy production, Republicans warn\nFive takeaways from the Trump administration officials, lawmakers, business leaders who spoke at POLITICO’s Energy Summit.\nRepublicans want to expand power production to shore up the grid and support the growth of data centers — but their own megabill risks doing the exact opposite.\nThat’s the message lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, industry executives and former Republican officials delivered on stage at the POLITICO Energy Summit on Tuesday.\nThe reconciliation bill that passed the House last month seeks to gut clean energy tax credits enacted by Democrats in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, particularly for wind and solar — two of the fastest-growing sources on the grid. President Donald Trump has derided those subsidies as the “Green New Scam,” and congressional Republicans have said the two technologies must stand on their own after decades of support.\nBut the speedy sunset of the investment and production tax credits under the House bill would hurt companies that have made investments based on the IRA, several of the Summit speakers said.\nThe House-passed bill is not “fair to businesses in the way that we’re phasing [the credits] out,” said Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis. “Investors have invested billions of dollars based on the rules of the road, and you have employees who have set careers based on these things.”\nEnergy companies have warned the bill could lead to the cancellation of hundreds of major electricity generation projects, just as the nation’s utilities prepare for a surge in power demand from new AI data centers.\nJohn Ketchum, chair and CEO of NextEra, the nation’s biggest owner of natural gas-fired power plants and the world’s leading generator of electricity from wind and solar power, said he agrees with the Trump administration’s declaration of an energy emergency — but warned renewables cannot be taken “off the table.”\n“We cannot afford to do that. If we do that, we will lose the AI race, and we will bring this economic expansion in the United States to a screeching halt,” Ketchum said. That’s because a new fleet of natural gas power plants won’t be ready until 2032, he added, and nuclear power will take even longer.\nAnd former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chair Neil Chatterjee, who served under the first Trump administration, said fossil fuels must be complemented by renewables and emerging technologies like geothermal and nuclear — as well as energy efficiency efforts.\n“We can’t possibly win the AI race and keep energy reliable and affordable with only fossil fuels,” Chatterjee said. “We need every available electron.”\nBut the backing for renewables drew pushback from Jarrod Agen, the executive director of Trump’s newly created National Energy Dominance Council, who said he was “very happy” with the bill the House produced.\nWind and solar are “intermittent” sources, he said, that “can’t stand on their own feet.”\nWhile the administration believes that nuclear energy will ultimately be the “perfect source,” fossil fuels and coal are the most reliable and secure sources today, Agen said.\nHere are some other takeaways from Tuesday’s event:\nPressure on Senate to tweak megabill\nCurtis, who has urged his Senate colleagues for months to preserve the IRA credits, specifically called for the bill to set a phase-out date for the clean energy tax credits based on when developers start construction of new projects, rather than on when a project begins producing electricity, as the House bill does. The House language discourages new investment because construction timelines are often uncertain, he said.\n“Changing it to say something about the date [construction] started would be a really significant difference and not really hurt the intent of what Republicans are trying to do on this bill,” Curtis said.\nThat echoed comments from Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who also urged changes to the bill’s prohibition on foreign involvement in projects, which he said is “completely unworkable in its current form.”\nEven Jennifer Granholm, who oversaw much of the growth spurred by the credits as the Biden administration’s energy secretary, told the summit the bill could be “workable” if the Senate fixes those two provisions, as well as restores rules that allow companies to buy and sell the tax credits.\nFERC’s fading independence\nFormer FERC leaders bemoaned President Donald Trump’s treatment of the agency, with Chatterjee warning the moves could turn the independent regulator into the “EPA,” which has whipsawed between administrations.\nTrump requested that former Democratic Chair Willie Phillips depart the commission, and last week declined to renominate current Republican Chair Mark Christie for a second term. His administration has moved to exert more power over other independent agencies as well.\n“If the White House exerts control over the agency and they have to clear everything through OIRA and through OMB, then effectively the role of FERC chairman is no longer as head of an independent agency, it’s basically a staff position,” Chatterjee told the audience.\nNobody can fathom what Elon’s deal is\nThe energy world is still processing the falling-out between Trump and his former “first buddy,” clean energy and electric vehicle entrepreneur Elon Musk.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) told the summit that Musk never brought up objections to the Republican megabill during a breakfast just hours after the House passed the measure.\n“He talked about AI, he talked about all this stuff that [was] energy,” Guthrie said. “Never mentioned the bill. And the bill had just been voted.”\nGranholm signaled that clean energy advocates could welcome Musk back into the fold, calling his electric vehicle company Tesla “amazing” while noting the “later part of his journey has been more challenging.”\nPressed on Musk’s support for clean energy, Agen, the White House official, said: “The President is in charge.”\nWhere Democrats turn next\nGranholm acknowledged that Democrats should have done a better job on the campaign trail last year selling their vision of job creation from the clean energy transition.\nBut the party going forward also needs to hone its messaging on “keeping costs low by using the cheapest form of energy,” which is renewables, Granholm said.\nHeinrich, too, forecast that Republicans’ fossil fuel push would drive up energy prices — and provide a political opening to Democrats.\n“We’re in a constrained supply environment and an increased demand environment,” he said. “People’s electricity bills all over the country are going to go up. What I can guarantee you is in the next election and the election after that Republicans are going to own increased energy prices.”",
            "Republicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon. 5:00\nrepublished\nRepublicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon\nA worker installs a solar panel on a roof. (Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON — Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.\nWhile some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by States Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.\nTrump vowed in early April that he would “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”\n“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.\nBut as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.\nCritics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.\nThey have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.\nU.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.\nKevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.\n“We’re just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we’ll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.\nDoffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.\nMoving away from fossil fuels\nThe suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.\nFor example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.\nBattery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.\nMost credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.\nA group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.\nThe House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.\nThe legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.\nFor example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.\nSchneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”\nSilfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.\nInvestment soared\nSpurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.\nOf the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.\nThe credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.\nDespite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.\n“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.\nActive manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.\nThe renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.\nActive solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.\nAdvanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.\nBut various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.\nLithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.\nChina largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.\nWhen accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.\nTroy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.\n“We’re getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.\n“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can’t get anything done, and that’s been very difficult to deal with,” he said.\nIndustry slowdown\nThe industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.\nSix announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.\nVan Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.\n“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”\nVan Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.\nSeveral companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.\nSpencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.\n“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you’re doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.\nToo expensive, Republicans say\nSome House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.\nKiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”\nHer co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.\nFar-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.\nThe right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.\nThe organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.\n“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.\nHope in the Senate?\nBut representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.\nJeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”\nPederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”\n“So we’re hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.\nDoffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.\n“They see what’s happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.\nThe House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”\n“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it’s gonna have. … But somehow we’re talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”\nLast updated 2:47 p.m., Jun. 9, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "Senate Republicans double down and target clean energy in draft tax bill. Senate Republicans double down and target clean energy in draft tax bill\nA proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...\nTax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.\nSenate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.\nUltimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.\n“They want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.\n“The reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden’s term. “Let’s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.”\nThe Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including “more reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.”\n“These modifications are a step in the right direction,” said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute’s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance “business certainty with fiscal responsibility.”\nWhether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump’s imminent Fourth of July target.\nNotably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.\nThe clean energy tax credits stem from Biden’s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.\nThe House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.\nLanguage included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out — though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned — some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.\nThe Senate proposal further “achieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.\nOn the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.\nAt the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.\n“The bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “If this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.”\nOpponents of the Senate’s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.\n“This is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,” said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nThe bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit — which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills — 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House’s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.\n“Canceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.\nThe Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.\nThis administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a “mandate,” incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly in Washington and Jennifer McDermott in Providence, R.I., contributed to this story.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement.\nThe SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up. A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThat’s one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt.\nThe markets have reflected investors’ worry.

            "GM slow-rolls its all-EV aspirations. GM slow-rolls its all-EV aspirations\nThe automaker is putting more money into gas-powered cars, making it all but impossible to reach its goal of selling only electric vehicles by 2035.\nGeneral Motors quietly closed the door this week on a goal to make only electric vehicles by 2035.\nThe automaker announced Tuesday that it would spend $4 billion on mostly gasoline-powered vehicles. While GM is not retreating from EVs, the investment means the company is “giving up any hope of achieving that [2035] goal,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an auto analyst at Telemetry, a Detroit-area research firm.\nAsked Wednesday whether the goal still exists, GM said in a statement, “We still believe in an all-EV future.”\nGM’s move away from the 2035 goal is less a singular failure and more a symptom of flagging support among many actors, including government, other automakers, charging companies and car buyers, analysts said.\nMuch has changed since GM set the EV target, just after President Joe Biden took office and amid a surge of confidence in the auto industry about widespread EV adoption. Four years later, the Trump administration is dismantling Biden-era federal support for EVs and implementing high tariffs, upsetting automakers’ production plans.\nThose federal moves, combined with a cooling desire for EVs among car buyers, has moved the sunset date for the internal combustion engine to a vague someday.\nGM is still ramping up EV production. Earlier this week, it trumpeted the fact that it sold 37,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year, making it the number two EV maker in the U.S. behind Tesla.\nThe company’s 2035 goal “was aspirational. It was more an idea than a strategy,” said Alan Baum, an independent Detroit auto analyst. “GM’s doing a better job than many of their competitors, but there’s obviously a relatively low ceiling because of the lack of supportive policy.”\nGM’s all-EV goal back in 2021 was one of the earliest and most prominent of a wave of automaker commitments to electric vehicles. At the time, GM CEO Mary Barra encouraged others to “follow suit and make a significant impact on our industry and on the economy as a whole.”\nOthers did follow — and all of those promises have been tempered by new realities.\nLast year, European automakers Volvo, Porsche, Volkswagen and Mercedes all dropped earlier goals that would have seen them producing all or mostly EVs by the early 2030s.\nBack in 2021, GM also put an asterisk on its 2035 target.\n“We say it as an aspirational goal, because to actually make that timing, we need some external things to come together also,” spokesperson Jessica James said at the time.\nBarra reiterated last month that the company still wants an “all-EV future.”\n“EVs are fundamentally better,” she said at a Wall Street Journal event late last month. “We have work to do to continue to get battery technology to give us greater density, so we have farther range. We need to have a robust charging infrastructure.”\nAutomakers, including GM, have been mostly mum in public as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress seek to kill tax incentives that make it cheaper for manufacturers to produce batteries and consumers to buy EVs.\nBut through the main U.S. automotive lobby, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, automakers have vociferously opposed California’s plans to require all-electric auto sales by 2035.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress voted to kill that California 2035 all-EV sales goal — the same one that GM first set for itself — through the Congressional Review Act. The move came after the Senate parliamentarian told lawmakers they couldn’t repeal the goal through the CRA.\nThe bill awaits a signature by Trump, after which the California attorney general has pledged to sue.\nWhat GM is doing\nGM’s announcement that it would invest $4 billion in domestic manufacturing essentially shuffles production among factories in ways that will help the company dodge Trump’s tariffs.\nIt is moving production of about a half-million gasoline-powered vehicles from Mexico to factories in the U.S., according to an analysis by Abuelsamid of Telemetry. Doing so will enable GM to avoid 25 percent tariffs that the Trump administration has placed on vehicles imported from Mexico.\nFor example, the production of several full-size SUVs and pickup trucks will transfer to GM’s Orion plant, north of Detroit. The gas-powered Equinox, a strong U.S. seller, will move to the Fairfax plant in Kansas City. The gas-running Blazer will go to the company’s Spring Hill plant in Tennessee.\nMeanwhile, EV production will be concentrated at GM’s Factory Zero, a dedicated EV plant in metro Detroit that is running far below capacity. That plant will continue making the electric Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, alongside other large EVs made in low volumes, including the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the Hummer.\nOther EVs will be made elsewhere. Other electric Cadillacs, for example, will be made at the Spring Hill plant, while a rebooted version of the Chevy Bolt will be produced at the Fairfax plant, which the company described as the site for the “next generation of affordable EVs.”\nThose changes, combined with other recent moves, make it clear that GM is laying the groundwork to produce gas-powered vehicles well into the 2030s.\nIn May, the Detroit automaker said it would ditch plans to make electric motors at its Towanda Production plant in Buffalo, New York, and instead spend $888 million to make V-8 engines.\nIn 2023, GM put $579 million toward refurbishing an engine plant in Flint, Michigan. Electric vehicles don’t have engines — they rely instead on batteries for propulsion.\nEngine factories are large, fixed investments that are meant to operate for 15 years or more, according to Neal Ganguli, a managing director and auto-manufacturing expert at the business advisory firm AlixPartners.\nMeanwhile, the manufacturing lines that make finished cars — like the ones GM unveiled this week — have shorter but still lengthy lives.\n“When you put these [manufacturing lines] in, you are planning on a five- to seven-year time horizon,” Ganguli said. “Maybe 10 years.”\nAnalysts said General Motors’ swerve back into the gasoline lane — and away from the path to all EVs by 2035 — is not a surprise, given the market and policy realities.\n“It was always a long shot at best,” said Abuelsamid."

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday celebrated his 79th birthday reviewing a parade of tanks, armament and marching soldiers gathered in the nation’s capital for the Army’s 250th anniversary celebration, amid heightened political tensions across the country and anti-Trump “No Kings” protests.\nThe nearly 90-minute parade cycled through the Army’s history, beginning with soldiers marching in Revolutionary War uniforms and ending with symbols of the Army’s future, including small robots carrying the U.S. Army flag and new West Point cadets about to be sworn in.\nMassive tactical vehicles rolled down Constitution Avenue one after another. Sherman tanks used by the military in World War II were followed by early 2000s-era howitzers and HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, that can launch newly developed precision missiles that reach up to 310 miles away, according to the Army.\nHIMARS were among the weaponry the U.S. provided to Ukraine’s forces under President Joe Biden.\n“The Army keeps us free,” Trump said in brief remarks at the conclusion of the parade, after Vice President J.D. Vance introduced him. “Every other country celebrates their victories, it’s about time America did too. That’s what we’re doing tonight.”\nBut tragedy and deep conflict marked the hours and days leading to the event. Early Saturday, a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home in an “act of political violence,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while another legislator and his wife were shot and gravely wounded.\nLate Friday, dozens of veterans breached barricades around the U.S. Capitol in protest of the Army parade. On Thursday, a Democratic U.S. senator from California was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference with the head of Homeland Security.\nLast weekend, multi-day protests erupted in Los Angeles after immigration raids swept across several Home Depots, typically where undocumented day laborers search for work, as Trump’s mass deportations continue to be carried out.\nAnd the president is in a legal standoff with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, after Trump ordered more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to be sent to LA without Newsom’s consent and Newsom sued. The Guard troops remained in LA Saturday after a federal appeals court froze a lower court’s order directing Trump to return command to Newsom.\nThe city saw a large protest Saturday afternoon, according to local media reports. A curfew of 8 p.m. Pacific time remained in effect, Mayor Karen Bass’ office said in a morning press release.\nAnd on Saturday night, the Salt Lake City Police Department said it was investigating a shooting that occurred during a “No Kings” protest and officials urged people to disperse the demonstration.\n‘Yeah, I wanna be there’\nIn Washington, spectators from across the country began lining barriers along the Army parade route hours before the event’s start.\nScott Aiken, 59, of Athens, Georgia, drove 10 hours for the parade. Aiken, who told States Newsroom he voted for Trump in the last three presidential elections, said he wanted to support the anniversary of the Army.\n“My father was in the Army, and my wife’s father was in the Army, and we’re a supportive military family. And when I heard the parade was going to happen, I thought, ‘Yeah, I wanna be there.’ So we drove up from Athens on Thursday, and did the Capitol tour yesterday, and here we are.”\nWhen asked about the timing of Trump’s birthday, Aiken said “whether it’s on his birthday or not, I don’t care. That’s not the purpose of this.”\nMembers of Trump’s Cabinet and other allies on social media posted well wishes and greetings. “Wishing a very happy birthday to our incredible President Donald J. Trump!” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X. Trump said on his social media site, Truth Social, “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a recent attack by Israel on Iran’s military leaders.\nNot everyone at the parade was wishing Trump well. Angelica Zetino, 24, and Shoshauna Brooks, 27, from Rockville and Gaithersburg, Maryland, stood out among the crowd as they carried signs protesting Trump’s administration, particularly recent immigration raids.\nThe pair began their morning at a “No Kings” protest in Rockville before heading to D.C.\n“They (the administration) just want to put on a show, which is OK, but we’re here to support the people that can’t have a voice for themselves,” Brooks said.\nTom Moore, 57, of the District of Columbia,, took issue with Trump’s words this week that any parade protesters would be met with force.\n“That’s not acceptable. He didn’t say violent protesters. I wasn’t planning on coming down here before that,” said Moore.\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on June 10 that any protests at the military parade “will be met with very heavy force.”\nRallies opposing Trump\nThroughout Saturday, protests unfolded across the U.S. bearing the theme “No Kings” to decry Trump’s military display on his own birthday and the mass immigration arrests.\nThe “No Kings” national organizers said in a press release that as of 2 p.m. Eastern, protesters had rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country, with 600 more events scheduled through the rest of the day. “No Kings” was organized by liberal groups and labor unions including Indivisible, the American Federation of Teachers, American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, MoveOn, 50501, Interfaith Alliance, Stand Up America, Common Defense, Human Rights Campaign and League of Conservation Voters.\nApproximately 60 protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday evening, according to the U.S. Capitol Police. Veterans for Peace, a group that organized the demonstration, posted photos of the arrests and of several demonstrators wearing “Veterans Against Fascists” t-shirts.\nPolice said 75 people peacefully demonstrated outside of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n“A short time later, approximately 60 people from the group left the Supreme Court so as a precaution, our officers began establishing a perimeter,” a police spokesperson told States Newsroom in an email. “A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps. Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests.”\nAmong those arrested was an elderly Vietnam veteran using a walker, Capitol Police confirmed.\nTwo mules and a dog\nA trickle of red “Make America Great Again” hats and apparel displaying support for the Army intermingled as supporters shuffled into the parade grounds Saturday afternoon.\nThe parade featured soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog, at a price tag in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Army.\nAmong the vehicles and equipment that rolled down Constitution Avenue between 15th and 23rd streets were Abrams tanks, first used in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm; and 9,500-pound titanium M777 lightweight Howitzers that fire 105-pound shells up to 24 miles and are currently in use on Ukraine’s battlefields.\nMilitary aircraft that could be seen above Washington in ceremonial flyovers, from AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawks and CH-47 Chinooks. Army Golden Knights parachuted down to the White House South Lawn, red smoke in their wake, to present Trump with a folded flag. The president has never served in the military.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern in the weeks leading up to the parade about the heavy tactical vehicles causing damage to the city’s streets. The Army Corps of Engineers had installed large steel plates ahead of the event to reinforce the roads.\nThe parade coincided with the Army’s 250th birthday celebration festival, which has been in the works for a year.\nThe parade appears to have been a late addition to the festivities. According to documentation obtained by local D.C. news outlet WTOP, America250 applied on March 31 for a permit for the parade. A May 21 press release about the parade from America250, which describes itself as a “nonprofit supporting organization to the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission,” celebrated Trump’s role in the event.\nTrump wanted a military parade during his first term, but the idea was dismissed because of cost, NBC reported at the time.\nThe last time the U.S. staged a celebratory military parade was in 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush to recognize the victory in the first Gulf War.\nImmigration enforcement and military\nThe big Army celebration early in Trump’s second term came as the president has intertwined the U.S. military with his immigration policy, as shown in LA and elsewhere.\nIn his first days in office, Trump signed five executive orders that laid out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extended other executive powers to speed up the president’s immigration crackdown.\nHe’s directed the Department of Defense to use a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to detain migrants. Military planes have been used in deportations – rather than standard commercial airplanes.\nIn April, he signed a proclamation creating a military buffer zone that stretches across Arizona, California and New Mexico just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.\nNational and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the Roosevelt Reservation to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement. A statutory exception in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, is the Insurrection Act of 1807.\nTrump has considered invoking the Insurrection Act, but has stopped short. The Insurrection Act is an existing presidential authority that would grant the president access to use all federal military forces, more than 1 million members.\nThe Insurrection Act has only been invoked 30 times, and is typically focused on an area of great civil unrest that has overwhelmed law enforcement.\nThe last time a president used it was 1992, during the Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the brutal beating of Black motorist Rodney King.\nIn calling in the National Guard in LA last week, Trump cited a rarely used statute known as the protective power – 10 U.S.C. 12406 – to use National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property, but not for broad law enforcement functions.\nLast updated 9:33 p.m., Jun. 14, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

By — Dan Cooney Dan Cooney Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/9-questions-about-trumps-military-parade Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 9 questions about Trump’s military parade Nation Jun 13, 2025 3:01 PM EDT By some measures, President Donald Trump’s military parade has been years in the making. The event planned for Saturday will mark the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, with thousands of soldiers and dozens of massive military vehicles and aircraft descending on the National Mall. The estimated cost: up to $45 million. Trump has reportedly long sought this kind of celebration. Eight years ago, he witnessed France’s Bastille Day parade and said the United States is “going to have to try and top it.” “For two and a half centuries, our brave soldiers have fought, bled, and died to keep us FREE, and now we will honor them with a wonderful Parade, one that is worthy of their service and sacrifice,” the president, who is expected to attend the parade, said on his Truth Social account late last month. Army spokesperson Heather Hagan called the celebration a “once-in-a-lifetime” occasion. “This is America’s Army,” she told PBS News. “It’s a free festival, free parade, free opportunity for all to participate in and come meet your Army.” Joggers pass the parade viewing stand on June 13 in front of the White House ahead of the upcoming U.S. Army 250th anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Military parades of this scale are uncommon in the U.S. The last one happened decades ago, in 1991, to celebrate the American and allied forces’ victory in the first Gulf War. Trump has gotten political blowback over the parade, including from Democrats who say the event is to celebrate himself. (The president’s 79th birthday is on Saturday). Veterans are divided over the parade, with some viewing the military parade as a commemoration of the institution’s history. Others have balked at the parade’s price tag and how the event papers over the Trump administration’s cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs and an ongoing effort to remove transgender troops from service. Roughly 6 in 10 U.S. adults, including 80% of Democrats, 72% of independents and 35% of Republicans, said the military parade was not a good use of government money, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research earlier this month. “It’s his typical personalization of national life — it’s all about him, it’s all about his ego, it’s all about his prominence, his success at becoming president of the United States,” said Richard Kohn, an emeritus professor of history and peace, war and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “To adopt the military for political and egotistical terms is really, to me, a mark of weakness — weakness of his self-regard, weakness of his position in American life, and it diminishes the importance of the Army’s 250 years of success.” People hold a banner on June 13 that reads, “Happy Birthday President Trump” as preparations continue ahead of the upcoming U.S. Army 250th anniversary celebration parade, near the White House in Washington, D.C. Photo by Carlos Barria/Reuters Peter Feaver, a political science and public policy professor at Duke University, said that while a parade like this is unusual, there is something “deeper” and “legitimate” worth celebrating. “This is a chance to remind the American people that, for 250 years, America’s freedoms have been protected by men and women who are willing to serve and answer the call of duty when they’re called. That’s partly why we have the free republic we have today that’s worth celebrating,” he said. “With that in mind, that goes a long way to mollifying some of the concerns I think people might otherwise have.” When and where is Trump’s military parade happening? The parade kicks off at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Saturday as part of the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday celebration on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The parade is scheduled to start at 23rd Street NW, near the Lincoln Memorial, and travel approximately 1 mile east along Constitution Avenue to 15th Street NW, near the Ellipse in front of the White House. The parade is set to last around one hour. Latest forecasts show rain and possible thunderstorms in D.C. on the day of the parade. The Army said the weather “is being closely monitored and taken into consideration, but at this point nothing has changed.” Who will attend? Trump and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll are expected to be among the VIPs in attendance. While the Army has not made a list of attendees publicly available, the White House’s Instagram page includes a video from Army veteran and retired mixed martial arts fighter Tim Kennedy, who shares where Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will be standing during the parade. Why is the military parade being held on June 14? The Army calls June 14, 1775, the official date of its establishment. The Second Continental Congress adopted a resolution on that day that called for “six companies of expert riflemen, be immediately raised in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, and two in Virginia” to join a New England regional army, called the Army of Observation, near Boston, according to the transcribed journals of the Continental Congress available through the Library of Congress. About two weeks later, “on the 3rd of July, George Washington makes it up there and assumes command of what is now called the Continental Army,” made up of the units established on June 14 and the Army of Observation, said Lee Reynolds, the public affairs officer for the U.S. Army Center of Military History. June 14 is also Flag Day, a commemoration of the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress decided what the official American flag would look like. How many troops are participating in the parade? A member of the U.S. Army Golden Knights parachute team glides past the Washington Monument on June 11 during their performance for the Twilight Tattoo ceremony as part of the Army’s 250th Birthday Festival in Washington, D.C. Photo by Nathan Howard/Reuters Some 6,700 soldiers will take part in the parade, representing different eras and units from the Army’s history. Many of the troops will be dressed in historic and present-day uniforms, and be accompanied by equipment and vehicles from those eras. For instance, as soldiers representing the 82d and 101st Airborne divisions from World War II march down Constitution Ave., at least one Ford GPW 1/4 Ton Jeep and one M4A1 Sherman tank are expected to ride alongside them. Aircraft from that era – the B-25 Mitchell bomber, P-51 Mustang and C-47 Skytrain transport plane – will fly over the parade. The parade will also include the Army’s parachute team, the Golden Knights, jumping onto the Ellipse in front of the White House. Future members of the military will also be included. Cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, those in Army basic training and students in ROTC programs at Virginia Military Institute, the Citadel and Texas A&M University will march with people who are getting ready to enlist in the Army. How many tanks and aircraft will take part in the parade? The Defense Department, writing in May about preparations for the parade, noted that “officials anticipate approximately 150 vehicles” and “50 aircraft” will take part in the parade. Included in the Army’s list of equipment for the parade: the M1A2/Abrams tank, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, Bradley Fighting Vehicle and AH-64 Apache helicopter. The birthday celebration festival will be located on a stretch of the National Mall near the Smithsonian Castle. It will also include equipment on display, including drones. How much will the festival and parade cost? The entire day of festivities is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, Hagan told PBS News. During a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Driscoll said the parade offers an opportunity to boost recruitment. “Our marketing budget we would spend to recruit those soldiers, I think our team believes that the investment of these dollars to tell that story will directly lead to a good, measurable, quantitative outcome for the Army,” he said. “It would be a massive tragedy to let this moment pass where we can tell this story and inculcate an entire generation of youth into this amazing story that is the United States Army.” How are federal and D.C. officials preparing for the event?

Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters The parade is a National Security Special Event, the highest federal security designation. This means it is getting the same security treatment as the Super Bowl, Trump’s inauguration, and the state funeral of the late President Jimmy Carter. “We’re preparing for an enormous turnout — hundreds of thousands of attendees,” Matt McCool, the special agent-in-charge for the U.S. Secret Service’s Washington, D.C., field office, said at a security briefing on Monday. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport said in a statement that the Federal Aviation Administration “is expected to suspend airline operations” at the airport, the closest to the National Mall and the site of a deadly collision between a military helicopter and a commercial flight earlier this year. “Customers with flight reservations for the evening of June 14 should check the status of their flights directly with their airline,” the statement read. The Army Corps of Engineers is using temporary metal plates and soft asphalt, held down with railroad ties, at key places along the parade route to mitigate damage caused by tanks and other vehicles. “Part of our contract here is to, when this is done, to remove these plates, to remove the asphalt, and to return every place on the roadway that we put these down back to exactly what it was before,” Col. Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said in a video posted on the Corps website. “Once the parade is complete, we want to return these roadways fully to the D.C. commuters and all those that use these roads to get to and from work and to visit our capital city.” Curry also noted during the Monday security briefing that the tanks have new rubber track pads to minimize any damage to the road. Are protests planned at Trump’s military parade? Security fencing is seen on June 13 ahead of the Army’s 250th birthday parade and celebration around the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images As protests against the Trump administration’s immigration raids continued in Los Angeles and other cities across the country, federal law enforcement officials said Monday they were monitoring and preparing for possible unrest if it happens near the parade and festival. “We have no intelligence about that happening here. But if it does, we have the resources to handle it,” McCool said. Several cities across the nation will be the sites of “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration on Saturday. But protest organizers said there will not be a demonstration in Washington, D.C. “Instead of allowing this birthday parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption,” the movement wrote on its website. While there is no specific designated zone for protests and First Amendment activity, the National Park Service has several permits pending, and, thus far, there have been no significant concerns, U.S. Park Police Chief Jessica Taylor told reporters Monday. Meanwhile, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that “those people who want to protest” are “going to be met with very big force.” When was the last time the U.S. held a similar military parade? On June 8, 1991, approximately 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall for a parade to celebrate the United States’ and its allies’ victory in the Gulf War. The New York Times reported the next day that the parade was “the largest military exhibition in the capital” since Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander during World War II, led a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue after the war ended. The newspaper also called the celebration “the most impressive display of war technology in recent history.” Kohn said that parade had a reason behind it – the “astounding” victory in Operation Desert Storm. The U.S. does military parades “to build morale and to build a kind of showcase for the military to the American people. But it has to be done carefully. It has to be done tastefully. It has to be done economically,” he said. “But to make a splash with it that’s corrupted by the president of the United States’ age and birthday, strikes many of us as both inappropriate and ridiculous.” Dan Sagalyn contributed reporting for this story.

            "WATCH: Trump&#8217;s military parade honoring Army&#8217;s 250th birthday rolls through DC. By — Lolita C. Baldor, Associated Press Lolita C. Baldor, Associated Press By — Michelle L. Price, Associated Press Michelle L. Price, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trumps-military-parade-honoring-armys-250th-birthday-rolls-through-dc Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter WATCH: Trump’s military parade honoring Army’s 250th birthday rolls through DC Politics Updated on Jun 14, 2025 9:10 PM EDT — Published on Jun 14, 2025 2:31 PM EDT WASHINGTON (AP) — The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king. Watch the parade and celebration in our video player above. The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army’s 250th anniversary. “Every other country celebrates their victories. It’s about time America did too,” Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade’s end. The president praised the strength of the military’s fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt. Early in the evening’s pageantry, the Army’s Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall. At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

Please check your inbox to confirm. Hours before the parade started, demonstrators turned out in streets and parks around the nation to sound off against the Republican president. They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital. Displays of military might The daylong display of America’s Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation’s military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard over the governor’s objections and dispatched the U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home. A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included “Where’s the due process?” and “No to Trump’s fascist military parade” as they marched toward the White House.

Organizers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Vendors outside the Army festival sold gear marking the military milestone. Others hawked Trump-themed merchandise. Larry Stallard, a retired American Airlines pilot, said he traveled to Washington from Kansas City for the weekend “to see the military and see Trump.” Stallard, who voted for Trump, said it was “hard to believe” people were upset about the cost of the event when “they blow that in 10 seconds on things that we don’t even need.” Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who voted for Trump, attended the daylong festival to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday, but said the parade “was a little over the top.” Pointing at a nearby tank, Haynes said that having them roll down the street is a “very bold statement to the world, perhaps.” WATCH: Military historian discusses the message Trump’s military parade sends to the world The parade was added just two months ago to the long-planned celebration of the Army’s birthday and has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates along the route. About 6 in 10 Americans said Saturday’s parade was “not a good use” of government money. The vast majority of people, 78%, said they neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Kathy Straus traveled from Richmond, Virginia, to attend the parade, carrying a sign criticizing its cost and arguing the money could have been used to feed veterans. “I thought that it would be more effective to come here than go to a protest with people that think similar to me,” said Straus. The parade wound down Constitution Avenue, lined with security fencing and barriers. A flyover of military aircraft included World War II-era planes, including a B-25 Mitchell bomber, and Army helicopters flew low over the crowd, below the top of the Washington Monument. Mounted soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an appearance — horses once played a crucial role in warfare, but today they’re mostly used in ceremonial events like today’s parade. Trump swore in 250 new recruits and returning soldiers into service, with soldiers repeating an oath after him. “Welcome to the United States Army! And have a great life,” Trump said to them afterward. Country music singer Warren Zeiders performed, as did “God Bless the U.S.A.” singer Lee Greenwood. The event was capped off by a fireworks show. It appeared that plans to have U.S. Air Force fighter jets fly over were scrapped because of the weather. Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Michelle L.

Price, Associated Press Michelle L. Price, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king. Watch the parade and celebration in our video player above. The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army’s 250th anniversary. “Every other country celebrates their victories. It’s about time America did too,” Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade’s end. The president praised the strength of the military’s fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers “fight, fight fight and they win, win win” — putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt. Early in the evening’s pageantry, the Army’s Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall. At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital.

The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit. “He’s expected to be okay,” Newkirk told the TV station. “He’s just fighting. We just want prayers for him.” Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta’s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released.

It is unclear why Emory decided to deliver the baby. The Associated Press has also tried to contact Newkirk. Smith’s family said Emory doctors told them they were not allowed to remove the devices keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected — generally around six weeks into pregnancy. Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr later issued a statement saying the law did not require medical professionals to keep a woman declared brain dead on life support. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,'” Carr said.

            "Brian Wilson, visionary leader of the Beach Boys, dies at 82. By — Hillel Italie, Associated Press Hillel Italie, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/brian-wilson-visionary-leader-of-the-beach-boys-dies-at-82 Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Brian Wilson, visionary leader of the Beach Boys, dies at 82 Arts Jun 11, 2025 1:25 PM EDT Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys’ visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired “Good Vibrations,” “California Girls” and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world’s most influential recording artists, has died at 82. Wilson’s family posted news of his death to his website and social media accounts Wednesday. Further details weren’t immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson’s longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge. The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers — Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums — he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock’s great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound. The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album “Pet Sounds” was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Smokey Robinson and Carole King. The Who’s drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited “Pet Sounds” as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad “God Only Knows” as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears. Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed “Pet Sounds” and his restored opus, “Smile,” before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go’s, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Monáe were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart. An endless summer The Beach Boys’ music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape — sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls — that resonated across time and climates. Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer — the wake-up guitar riff that opens “Surfin’ USA”; the melting vocals of “Don’t Worry Baby”; the chants of “fun, fun, fun” or “good, good, GOOD, good vibrations”; the behind-the-wheel chorus “’Round, ’round, get around, I get around.” Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand. The band’s innocent appeal survived the group’s increasingly troubled back story, whether Brian’s many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson’s ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create. From the suburbs to the national stage Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian’s bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group’s only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, “Surfin,’” a minor hit released in 1961. They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for “Surfin,’” they discovered the record label had tagged them “The Beach Boys.” Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band’s recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer. Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with “Surfin’ USA,” so closely modeled on Berry’s “Sweet Little Sixteen” that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: “If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody’d be surfin,’ / like Cali-for-nye-ay.” From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with “I Get Around” and “Help Me, Rhonda” and narrowly missing with “California Girls” and “Fun, Fun, Fun.” For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby. READ MORE: This waltz is the unofficial soundtrack of floating through space. Soon it will beam through the cosmos Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love’s nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. “The Warmth of the Sun” was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged — to some skepticism — he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. “Don’t Worry Baby,” a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man’s confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian’s crippling anxieties. Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector’s “Wall of Sound” productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to “Dance, Dance, Dance” or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to “California Girls.” By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country’s answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of “art” and leaving Wilson a broken man. The Beach Boys vs. The Beatles The Beatles opened with “Rubber Soul,” released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as “She Loves You” and “A Hard Day’s Night.” Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them. Wilson worked for months on what became “Pet Sounds,” and months on the single “Good Vibrations.” He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From “I Know There’s an Answer” to “You Still Believe in Me,” many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of “Good Vibrations,” a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space. The results were momentous, yet disappointing. “Good Vibrations” was the group’s first million-seller and “Pet Sounds,” which included the hits “Sloop John B” and “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a “concept” album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that “Pet Sounds” couldn’t be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose “Rhapsody in Blue” had inspired him since childhood. But the album didn’t chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. “Revolver” and “Sgt. Pepper,” the Beatles’ next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys’ vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of “Pet Sounds.” The Beatles’ epic “A Day in the Life” reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and “Sgt. Pepper” as the album to beat. All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece — a “teenage symphony to God” he called “Smile.” It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed “Smile,” then canceled it. Remnants, including the songs “Heroes and Villains” and “Wind Chimes” were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on “Smiley Smile,” dismissed by Carl Wilson as a “bunt instead of a grand slam.” The stripped down “Wild Honey,” released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn’t restore the band’s reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical ’60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.

From the suburbs to the national stage Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian’s bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group’s only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, “Surfin,’” a minor hit released in 1961. They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for “Surfin,’” they discovered the record label had tagged them “The Beach Boys.” Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band’s recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer. Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with “Surfin’ USA,” so closely modeled on Berry’s “Sweet Little Sixteen” that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: “If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody’d be surfin,’ / like Cali-for-nye-ay.” From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with “I Get Around” and “Help Me, Rhonda” and narrowly missing with “California Girls” and “Fun, Fun, Fun.” For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby. READ MORE: This waltz is the unofficial soundtrack of floating through space. Soon it will beam through the cosmos Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love’s nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. “The Warmth of the Sun” was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged — to some skepticism — he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. “Don’t Worry Baby,” a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man’s confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian’s crippling anxieties. Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector’s “Wall of Sound” productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to “Dance, Dance, Dance” or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to “California Girls.” By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country’s answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of “art” and leaving Wilson a broken man. The Beach Boys vs. The Beatles The Beatles opened with “Rubber Soul,” released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as “She Loves You” and “A Hard Day’s Night.” Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them. Wilson worked for months on what became “Pet Sounds,” and months on the single “Good Vibrations.” He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From “I Know There’s an Answer” to “You Still Believe in Me,” many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of “Good Vibrations,” a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space. The results were momentous, yet disappointing. “Good Vibrations” was the group’s first million-seller and “Pet Sounds,” which included the hits “Sloop John B” and “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a “concept” album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that “Pet Sounds” couldn’t be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose “Rhapsody in Blue” had inspired him since childhood. But the album didn’t chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. “Revolver” and “Sgt. Pepper,” the Beatles’ next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys’ vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of “Pet Sounds.” The Beatles’ epic “A Day in the Life” reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and “Sgt. Pepper” as the album to beat. All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece — a “teenage symphony to God” he called “Smile.” It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed “Smile,” then canceled it. Remnants, including the songs “Heroes and Villains” and “Wind Chimes” were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on “Smiley Smile,” dismissed by Carl Wilson as a “bunt instead of a grand slam.” The stripped down “Wild Honey,” released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn’t restore the band’s reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical ’60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.

            "‘How we ended up here’: Authors on effects of abortion bans. Amanda Becker, reporter for The 19th, and Colleen Long, editor for NBC News, presented their post-Dobbs books at the 2025 Gaithersburg Book Festival in Gaithersburg, Maryland, May 17. Becker’s “You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America” and Long and Rebecca Little’s “I’m Sorry for My Loss: An Urgent Examination of Reproductive Care in America,” were both published in 2024. (Photo by Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)\nDuring the pandemic, when many people were reevaluating their life goals, Colleen Long texted her childhood best friend and fellow journalist Rebecca Little to see if, together, they could write a relatable, even funny, book about pregnancy loss.\n“My friend Rebecca … she likes to say she kind of had the pu pu platter of loss,” Long said during an author panel at the 2025 Gaithersburg Book Festival in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on May 17. “She had all sorts of terrible things happen: a stillbirth; she had to end the pregnancy of twins; she had several miscarriages. And I had a stillbirth.”\nThey wanted to understand why it was so hard to talk about pregnancy loss in public, and thus difficult to process.\n“She and I started talking about how what we would really like to do is to write a book about why we are so bad at talking about pregnancy loss,” said Long, a senior editor at NBC News. “What is it about our culture that makes it impossible to sort of discuss this, and yet, when it happens to you, then all of these people come out of the woodwork and talk about it. We’re saying it’s like ‘Fight Club,’ but maybe we should be taking fewer cues, you know, from Brad Pitt.”\nLong and Little ended up speaking to about 100 people who experienced some form of pregnancy loss and continue to hear from people with experiences since their book, “I’m Sorry for My Loss: An Urgent Examination of Reproductive Care in America,” came out last year. Their book is also about how the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of federal abortion rights in June 2022, with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, has exacerbated the consequences when pregnancy doesn’t go the way it’s supposed to. In the book, Little and Long document how pregnant and miscarrying women have been denied standard medical treatments because of state abortion bans, and how many people — disproportionately people of color — have been criminalized for decisions made while pregnant, long before Dobbs.\n“In some ways, reproduction in America has been stripped back to basics, but we don’t find ourselves suddenly reliving a colonial life,” they write. “We would argue it’s more perverse in some ways because the advances in medicine are available, but they’re being withheld. Like the Back to the Future timeline where Biff Tannen runs a dystopian Hill Valley, we’re going back to a place we never really were.”\nSubscribe to Reproductive Rights Today\nWant a better understanding of abortion policy in the states? Sign up for our free national newsletter. Reproductive Rights Today is a comprehensive daily wrap-up of changes to reproductive rights in the states, the front lines in the fight over abortion access in a Post-Roe America.\nJoining the panel was The 19th’s Amanda Becker, whose “You Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America,” also published in 2024, tells the story of the first year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, from the perspective of abortion providers and reproductive rights activists.\n“I truly think a lot of the people I feature in my book are heroes,” Becker said. “Being around them was just so incredibly inspiring, and how hard they’re working to help people and take care of people and preserve the ability to access care where people can still get it, and fighting to get it back where they can’t.”\nStates Newsroom reporter Sofia Resnick moderated the Q&A with the authors. The version below has been edited for brevity and clarity. The full conversation is scheduled to be broadcast on C-SPAN 2 Book TV on June 8.\nStates Newsroom: You both were working on these books before the Dobbs decision and you’ve been both covering major national stories. Why did you both decide to dedicate so much time to this particular story?\nColleen Long: When Roe fell, it really sort of informed our reporting in a different way, because a lot of the procedures that are used to treat pregnancy loss are used to treat abortion. So, our book was focused more on pregnancy loss. But really, our sort of principle for the book is, what has happened in the past 50 years — since Roe has been codified and now fallen — is that we sort of hold out everything that isn’t a perfect pregnancy or the end of an unwanted pregnancy. But there’s this vast middle ground that a lot of people tend to experience. … When Roe fell, everybody was like, “Oh, this is not going to affect miscarriage care. This could possibly not affect a woman who is wanting a pregnancy and is unable to continue her pregnancy.” And so what we’ve seen, obviously, since the fall of Roe, is that actually these things are all very much intertwined. So our idea was to better inform everyone.\nAmanda Becker: My background is as a political reporter, not a health care reporter. So I was more interested in how reproductive rights, and abortion specifically, have really reordered our politics. It’s the biggest political story of my lifetime, and because I’m a person that was capable of giving birth, I also thought it was the most important story overall that affects more than half of this country directly. And I would argue that it affects everyone indirectly in some way.\nI just knew it was going to be a very big year, and that’s why I decided to structure the book — it literally starts with the decision in June, and it ends the next June — because it was just such a sprawling story that I knew would affect every single state in a different way, and the residents in those states in different ways.\nSN: What were the parts of your books that were hardest to write?\nLong: Rebecca trained at [the famed Chicago improv theater] Second City, so she’s funny, she will be the first to tell you. We wanted to make this book readable … so we worked on the tone a lot. That said, the hardest part about writing this book was interviewing the people. We interviewed 100 different people, and they ran the gamut. Some experienced a miscarriage, some had a stillbirth, some had multiple stillbirths. Some had to end their pregnancies because of a host of reasons. We interviewed people from every religion, conservative people, liberal people, all kinds of different people, and it was hard. As a journalist, you are used to listening to people and hearing stories that are upsetting, but I think the thing that was most upsetting for us was how common a lot of their stories were in that they all felt, like, alone, unsure, didn’t know where to go.\nBecker: I was trying to write a book that was ultimately hopeful. … I would say the most difficult points were just, like, the overwhelmingness of what was happening that year. And because my book is kind of looking at the loss of abortion rights as happening in tandem with the erosion of our democracy, which is something I care a lot about, it just would start to feel overwhelming sometimes. Like, how are we going to fix these things that have been happening over the last 100 years, you know? How can we get reproductive rights back unless we fix gerrymandering?\nSN: In your respective historical research, what were some things that surprised you?\nBecker: I was floored when I found out that the American Medical Association came into being to elevate male doctors over female midwives and then go on an anti-abortion crusade over the next 30 years that eventually changed the laws in almost every state in this country.\n[Addressing Long:]And you get into this in your book, too: The father of gynecology did non-consensual experiments without anesthesia on enslaved women. And I’m learning this history of women’s healthcare and gynecological care and being like, this is how we ended up here.\nLong: We have a long history in the beginning of our book — it’s literally called “How We Got Here” — to sort of explain how our attitudes have changed over the years on pregnancy and pregnancy loss. Because, for example, the way we view pregnancy — this was really surprising to me — the way we view pregnancy today is really only like 47 to 48 years old, and it has to do so much with modern medical advances, sonograms, the home pregnancy test. Our ideas about how we bond and the way we discuss pregnancy is just so different.\nSN: What have been some of the impacts of increased anti-abortion laws on health care and grief and loss?\nLong: My OB-GYN came from Oklahoma [where abortion is banned] because she was, like, “I feel as though I can’t practice safely.” … And the other thing we’re noticing is that doctors — not OB-GYNs, but like any doctors — they’re considering where to go to medical school. And the states in which the abortion laws are very strict, they’re sort of looking away from those states because … they’re afraid of their own medical care. So I would expect us in — I don’t know, five years, maybe, let’s say six years — we’re going to start seeing like a real disparate situation in the United States, where we have some states with very good medical care, and other states, which, let’s face it, already had poor medical care, are going to have worse medical care.\nBecker: You don’t find out about a lot of really bad fetal abnormalities until the 20- to 21-week anatomy scan, so [people] made really difficult decisions, and a lot of them that I’ve spoken to feel like they can’t even grieve that openly because of what’s in the public discourse right now about abortion and abortion bans. Yes, they had an abortion, but they’re grieving a pregnancy that they very much wanted and a child that they very much wanted, and I think it’s just making it more difficult for people to talk about.\nLong: This is where politics is tricky. … We interviewed a lot of women who identified as politically left-leaning who felt they weren’t allowed to mourn their miscarriage because they didn’t want to be seen as a traitor to the cause of abortion rights, which is hard.\nAnd then … you have what has happened with the restrictions and the fetal personhood laws. … This is a very new concept, to have the sort of baby and the mother have the same legal rights, and that’s what we’re seeing play out in some of these places. And it plays out in really strange ways. Because when you have a life or death situation and you have these two entities, one does not exist without the other. And like, who is worth saving more? It’s just a really complicated morass.\nBecker: If you talk to experts, both legal and medical, in fetal personhood and what it means in practice, they will tell you that in a fetal personhood situation where you’re putting at odds the rights of a fetus versus the right of the gestational parent, the fetus always wins when we apply fetal personhood. And so we’re going to see more and more of that.\nAudience Member: It seems to me that in the last political campaign, we started to hear a lot about the impact of these laws on women, and somehow that’s fallen out of the news. And so how do we mobilize around this issue?\nBecker: I think we were hearing about it in part because it was an election season and a presidential election, and I would expect that to come back around for the midterms and the next time we have a lot of abortion ballot measures on ballots. … Politicians pay attention to what gets them elected or not elected. So if that’s a reason you’re going to elect someone or not elect them, let them know that.\nLong: I covered the [presidential] campaign, and like even during the campaign, I felt like these issues sort of only caught fire when they thought it could be a winning issue. And the Democrats are in a weird rebuilding phase right now, and so I think they’re trying to figure out what works and what doesn’t. … They were really hoping that reproductive rights and reproductive health was going to drive people to the polls, in particular women, and in the end, they lost. … And the conversation is no longer happening. But if you think about it, the conversation was never happening. It only just started happening, and then it was a blip. And then now we’re sort of back to where we were, which is super annoying.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "Inside the legal fight over the telehealth clinics that help women defy abortion bans. Inside the legal fight over the telehealth clinics that help women defy abortion bans\nEvery month, thousands of women evade abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to send them pregnancy-ending drugs through the mail\nEvery month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.\nWhether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.\nDr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.\nSo far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.\n\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,” said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.\nAs more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.\nErik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.\n\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,” said Baptist, director of the group’s Center for Life. ”And so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.”\n“That is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,” said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. “At a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?”\nDecades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines — mifepristone and misoprostol — to terminate pregnancies.\nBut it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nThe Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.\nAt some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.\nFor instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.\nPills can arrive in a less than a week.\n“This has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don’t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,” said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.\nWhen dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.\nTwenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.\nOf those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\nLouisiana’s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state’s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)\n“These are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,” Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. “They are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.”\nJulie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won’t be “bullied and intimidated” into ceasing operations.\nOther telehealth abortion providers said they also won't be deterred by legal threats.\n“I have been working in this field for 25 years and this is part of the work,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, founder and director of Aid Access, an abortion pill supplier. ”It’s something that we all anticipated would happen,\" she said of the legal challenges.\nA doctor who is part of A Safe Choice, a network of California-based physicians that prescribes abortion pills to women in all 50 states, told The Associated Press he believes he is protected by the state's shield law, but is also taking precautions.\n“I’m not going to be traveling outside of California for a very long time,” said the doctor, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he wanted to protect his identity for safety reasons.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.",
            "Abortion opponents are coming for mifepristone using what medical experts call ‘junk science’. 13:58\nNews Story\nAbortion opponents are coming for mifepristone using what medical experts call ‘junk science’\nUsing flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.\nPackages of Mifepristone tablets are displayed at a family planning clinic on April 13, 2023, in Rockville, Maryland. (Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nUsing flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.\nThe effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug’s approval — and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.\nMainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and — in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.\n“There’s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.\nReleased in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.\nAnother paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.\nDays later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.\nA miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.\nThat study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.\n“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.\nJames Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”\nThese studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.\nMifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.\nNationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.\nMeanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.\n“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”\nThe International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThough no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.\n“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.\n“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.\nThrough the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.\nThe Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.\n“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.

I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.\nReleased in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.\nAnother paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.\n“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.\nDays later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.\nA miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.\nThat study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.\n“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.\nJames Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”\nThese studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.\nMifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.\nNationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.\nMeanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.\n“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”\nThe International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThough no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.\n“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.\n“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.\nThrough the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.\nThe Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.\n“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.\nKeep the press free.

            "The Fed holds interest rates steady again as trade tensions heat up. - The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the fourth time in 2025.\n- Powell has signaled the Fed is waiting to see the impacts of Trump's tariffs before cutting rates.\n- The FOMC penciled in two interest-rate cuts for 2025, depending on economic conditions.\nAmerica's interest rates will hold steady once again — and the Fed is keeping a close eye on President Donald Trump's trade war.\nIn line with forecasts, The Federal Open Market Committee announced Wednesday that it will not cut rates, holding for the fourth time this year. The decision comes as Trump's quick-changing tariff policies with top trade partners have spooked businesses and investors for the past several months. CME FedWatch, which anticipates interest-rate changes based on market moves, had projected a 99% chance of steady rates in June.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concern that Trump's trade plans will negatively impact US companies and consumers, and said that the central bank is waiting to see the clear impact of these policies before making a rate-cut decision.\nDuring Wednesday's press conference, Powell said \"uncertainty is unusually elevated\" but he \"remains squarely focused\" on fostering maximum US employment and stable prices. He hopes that holding rates will make the Fed \"well positioned to respond in a timely way\" to economic developments — especially changes in trade, federal immigration policy, and global conflicts.\nIn its quarterly release of economic projections, the Fed still penciled in two cuts for this year, but when (and if) those cuts occur depends on economic conditions. The call to keep rates at steady this month comes alongside a modest rise in inflation. The year-over-year inflation rate ticked up in May to 2.4% from 2.3%, a figure lower than expected but still above the Fed's 2% goal. Wednesday's projections show the Fed's outlook has worsened since March, notably that expectations for inflation and unemployment have risen, and forecasts for GDP have declined.\n\"We expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in the coming months,\" Powell said Wednesday, adding, \"Someone has to pay for the tariffs.\"\nStill, he said that the job market is healthy and stable. Unemployment is low and the US added jobs last month. While the labor market is slowing due to low quit and job vacancy rates, there's \"nothing that's troubling at this time\" and \"AI should be creating jobs at the same time it may be replacing\" others.\nSoft data indicators, like the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, have fluctuated in recent months, further indicating that Americans are feeling the heat of high prices and tariff whiplash. And major events — like Israel's attack on Iran last week — could also impact inflation rates and the price of in-demand resources like oil going forward.\nThe president has repeatedly pushed for the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later: \"'Too Late' Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn't have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much!\" Trump wrote in a May 8 Truth Social post. \"Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and 'eggs') down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S.\"\nFollowing a meeting with Trump at the end of May, Powell said in a statement that, \"he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.\"\nWhen asked about Trump's comments, Powell said that he's solely focused on the Fed's public service mission: \"That's what matters to us,\" he said Wednesday. \"That's all that matters.\"",

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has been under pressure to lower interest rates from President Trump — who is threatening to replace Powell if he doesn't.\nWell, Powell didn't cut rates on June 18 and doesn't seem too worried about his job security.\nWho wants that job? The Fed hasn't cut short-term interest rates this year, and there are plenty of critics on both sides of the issue. The low end of the target federal funds rate has been at 4.25% since before Christmas. And there it remains.\nHere's how the extended interest rate pause is impacting deposits, credit, and debt.\nHow the interest rate pause affects checking and savings accounts\nThe microscopic interest you earn on your deposit accounts remains nearly unseen by the naked eye.\nChecking accounts\nMany checking accounts pay just pennies of interest on the dollar. The cash is moving in and out of your account as you earn an income and pay bills. It's the convenience of liquidity that limits your earning power.\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts remains at 0.07%. That barely classifies as a fraction.\nSavings accounts\nInterest rates on savings accounts have actually fallen.. The latest average is down to 0.38%. But this is not where savvy savers keep serious money.\nHigh-yield savings accounts have been resilient money havens. They're still in the 4% range, with some financial providers slightly above or below that.\nThis is one category where shopping really pays off.\nDig deeper: 10 best high-yield savings accounts\nMoney market accounts\nIf you have $10,000 or more that you want to keep on the sidelines but nearby, money market accounts have been convenient — but low-paying. National average payouts have trickled downward here too, now at 0.59%.\nA better option might be a high-yield money market account, where rates are still near or a little better than 4%.\nRead more: 10 best high-yield money market accounts\nWhat an on-hold Fed interest rate policy does to CDs\nCD rates have been slowly sinking. A 12-month CD is averaging 1.62%, but you can find better deals if you're willing to take the time to hunt them down — and park your money in a bank that may not be in your city.\nYour minimum deposit and term will affect your rate.\nLearn more: These are the best CD rates on the market today.\nWhat the latest Federal Reserve rate pause will mean for mortgages and personal loans\nHome mortgages\nMortgage rates. Who wants to talk about 'em? The only popular conversation begins with \"when will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?\"\nHome loan rates are still lingering in the upper-6% range.\nThe Fed's manipulation of overnight interest rates charged to banks doesn't directly steer mortgage rates. Those are more influenced by the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note. The bond market reacts to forecasts for economic growth — or the lack of it.\nBad economic news, such as a resurgence of inflation or a recession, can move rates down. But who is hoping for that?\nHousing industry analysts with the Mortgage Bankers Association, Redfin, Realtor.com, and Zillow expect mortgage rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range through the end of this year.\nDig deeper: When will mortgage rates go down?\nPersonal loans\nPersonal loan interest rates have been hovering in the 12% range for well more than a year. They were around 9.5% for three years, from 2020 to 2022. Like mortgage rates, it will take time for them to get close to that again.\nWhat happens to credit cards when the Fed holds interest rates\nCredit card interest impacts everyone — except those who pay off their balance each month.\nOf course, that's a good thing to aim for, but in the meantime, c'mon, Fed, give us a break. Credit card rates have spiraled from around 15% in 2021 to over 21% in 2025.\nCredit card companies are clinging to the high interest that consumers are apparently still willing to pay. There's been no movement downward, even with last year's Fed rate cuts.\nYahoo Finance tip: The best way to earn a lower credit card interest rate right away is to ask. If you make regular payments and have seen your credit score improving, it's a good time to call your credit card provider and ask for a lower interest rate.\nHow the Fed's interest rate policy impacts your investments\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.",

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above. The Fed kept its key rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting Wednesday, and said the economy is expanding at “a solid pace.” Changes to the Fed’s rate typically — though not always — influence borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans. WATCH: Powell delivers remarks as Trump pushes budget that could add $5.1 trillion in debt The central bank also released its latest quarterly projections for the economy and interest rates. It expects noticeably weaker growth, higher inflation, and slightly higher unemployment by the end of this year than it had forecast in March, before President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2. Most of those duties were then postponed April 9. The Fed also signaled it would cut rates just once in 2026, down from two cuts projected in March. Fed officials see inflation, according to its preferred measure, rising to 3% by the end of this year, from 2.1% in April. It also projects the unemployment rate will rise to 4.5%, from 4.2% currently. Growth is expected to slow to just 1.4% this year, down from 2.5% last year. Despite the gloomier outlook, Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have underscored that they are holding off from any changes to their key rate because of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the tariffs and economic outlook. Some of the Fed’s policymakers have expressed particular concern that the duties could boost prices, creating another surge of inflation just a couple of years after the worst inflation spike in four decades. Many economists say that without the higher import taxes, the Fed would likely be cutting its rate further. Yet so far, inflation has cooled this year to just 2.1% in April, essentially back at the central bank’s target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, remains elevated at 2.5%. Trump has pointed to the mild inflation figures to argue that the Fed should lower borrowing costs and has repeatedly criticized Powell for not doing so. On Wednesday he called Powell “stupid” and accused him of being “political” for not cutting rates. Trump has previously argued that a rate cut would boost the economy. Now his focus has shifted to the federal government’s borrowing costs, which have shot higher since the pandemic, with interest payments running at an annual rate of more than $1 trillion. Pushing the Fed to cut rates simply to save the government on its interest payments typically raises alarms among economists, because it would threaten the Fed’s congressional mandate to focus on stable prices and maximum employment. One of Trump’s complaints is that the Fed isn’t cutting rates even as other central banks around the world have reduced their borrowing costs, including in Europe, Canada, and the U.K. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan kept its key short-term rate unchanged at 0.5%, after actually raising it recently. But the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have reduced their rates this year in part because U.S. tariffs are weakening their economies. So far the U.S. economy is mostly solid, with the unemployment rate low. The Bank of England has cut its rate twice this year but is expected to keep it unchanged at 4.25% when it meets Thursday.

            "The Bond Market Faced a Volatile First Half—What's Next?. Key Takeaways\nBond markets have been volatile so far this year on uncertainty about tariffs and fiscal deficits.\n-\nHowever, if the economy weakens, bonds could be more attractive to investors.\n-\nBond yields could push higher if the tension between the Federal Reserve and President Donald Trump is ratch.\n-\nFor all the volatility in bond markets this year, interest rates haven’t changed much—but sustained decreases in long-term rates may be on the way.\nFederal Reserve rate cuts would lower interest costs for credit cards, student loans, and other products based on short-term rates. However, the Fed has less influence over longer-term rates, such as the 10-year U.S. Treasury. Those are based more on how markets view the economy and inflation in the decade ahead.\nForecasting the next decade is always tricky, but it got even harder in April. Bond markets were volatile as traders fretted Trump’s tariffs could drive inflation, tank the economy and reshape supply chains permanently.\nFears dissipated after Trump paused many tariffs, but May saw more volatility as higher U.S. fiscal deficits worried investors.\nJune was tamer, as inflation data stayed mostly subdued and economic data underperformed. If that sticks, long-term rates may fall as investors price in a weaker outlook.\nLonger-dated bonds look “attractive,” said Brij Khurana, a portfolio manager at Wellington Management.\nOutperformance in bonds would mark a shift after the toll that post-COVID inflation spikes took on the bond market. Bonds have historically been a safe haven from volatile stocks—bonds did well whenever stocks suffered—but the last few years threw off that correlation.\nThe relationship may return if the economy weakens.\n“If we are moving into a much slower growth environment than we thought, I think bonds have a better hedging capability to stocks than they have in quite some time,” Khurana said.\nWhat May Cause Rates to Stay High?\nBut there’s also a risk that rates will stay elevated.\nThe Fed could keep short-term rates high, dampening hopes that long-term rates will follow them downward. While tariff-driven inflation hasn’t shown up yet, it’s a risk that has thus far kept the Fed on hold.\n“I don't think that they need to lower rates at the moment,” said Cal Spranger, fixed income manager and wealth manager at Badgley Phelps, adding that rates aren’t “what is giving the economy heartburn.”\nThe Fed keeping rates flat could increase its friction with Trump, who’s pressed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to slash rates and give the economy an extra boost. Powell’s term is up in May 2026, but Trump has weighed picking a new Fed chair far sooner than that.\nNaming a successor before the end of Powell’s term would create a “shadow Fed chair,” who could influence the policy outlook based on public comments. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was considering that prospect late last month.\nThe scenario has long unsettled markets—that Trump’s desired pick will call for rate cuts even if the Fed thinks otherwise. That could damage the central bank’s credibility with investors—who have long valued the Fed’s ability to make decisions independently.\n“The announcement of a ‘shadow’ Chair risks a loss to Fed independence that pushes longer-dated yields higher,” wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.",
            "Wall Street's record-setting run keeps motoring on expectations for easier interest rates. NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street's record-setting run keeps rolling, and stocks are rising Thursday after a mixed set of U.S. data kept the path clear for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.7% and was on track to set an all-time high for a third straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 546 points, or 1.2%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher. Both are also heading toward records.\nTreasury yields eased in the bond market following the economic reports, which were some of the final data releases left that could sway the Federal Reserve's thinking before its meeting next week. The unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will cut its main interest rate for the first time this year.\nOne of Thursday's reports said more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the number of layoffs could be rising. It’s the latest discouraging signal on the job market, where hiring has slowed substantially. The labor market had seemed to be settling into a low-hire, low-fire state, but an increase in layoffs could put it in an even tighter vise.\nThe hope on Wall Street has been for a slowdown, but only for a precisely measured one. The job market has to be worrying enough to get the Fed to cut interest rates, which can give a kickstart to the economy and to prices for investments, but not so weak that it causes a recession.\nThe Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates throughout 2025 because of the threat that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could make inflation worse. That’s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher.\nA report on inflation Thursday showed prices are continuing to rise faster for U.S. households than the Fed hopes, but only by the amount that economists expected. Consumers paid prices for food, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.9% higher in August than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July’s 2.7% inflation rate.\nThat’s above the Fed’s target of 2%, but traders believe not by enough to convince the Fed that inflation is the bigger problem now for the economy than the slowing job market. The Fed has just one tool to fix either problem, and moving interest rates to help one often means hurting the other in the short term.\n“Right now, inflation is a key subplot, but the labor market is still the main story,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nOn Wall Street, Centene helped lead the market with a jump of 12.1%. The health care company said its business results through August are tracking with the profit forecast it had earlier given for the year. That's more than analysts are forecasting.\nOpendoor Technologies soared 51.5% after the company, which helps people buy and sell homes online, said it hired Shopify’s chief operating officer, Kaz Nejatian, as its CEO. It also announced a $40 million investment by one of its founders and an investment firm tied to another founder.\nKroger rose 1.9% after the grocer reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue came up just shy of forecasts. It also raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for profit over the full year.\nHelping to keep the market's gain in check was Oracle, which fell 3.6%. But that gave back only a bit of its monster surge from the day before, when it soared nearly 36% for its best day since 1992 on excitement about multibillion contracts won amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes ticked higher after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at its latest meeting. The European bank is on pause following an earlier set of cuts, and its president, Christine Lagarde, said future moves are “not on a predetermined path.”\nFrance’s CAC 40 rose 0.6%, and Germany’s DAX returned 0.3%.\nIn Asia, indexes were mostly higher. Stocks jumped 1.7% in Shanghai but fell 0.4% in Hong Kong.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.01% from 4.04% late Wednesday.\n___\nAP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.",

The job market has to be worrying enough to get the Fed to cut interest rates, which can give a kickstart to the economy and to prices for investments, but not so weak that it causes a recession.\nThe Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates throughout 2025 because of the threat that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could make inflation worse. That’s because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher.\nA report on inflation Thursday showed prices are continuing to rise faster for U.S. households than the Fed hopes, but only by the amount that economists expected. Consumers paid prices for food, gasoline and other costs of living that were 2.9% higher in August than a year earlier, a slight acceleration from July’s 2.7% inflation rate.\nThat’s above the Fed’s target of 2%, but traders believe not by enough to convince the Fed that inflation is the bigger problem now for the economy than the slowing job market. The Fed has just one tool to fix both problems, and moving interest rates to help one often hurts the other in the short term.\n“Right now, inflation is a key subplot, but the labor market is still the main story,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nOn Wall Street, Kroger rose 1.6% after the grocer reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue came up just shy of forecasts. It also raised the bottom end of its forecasted range for profit over the full year.\nOpendoor Technologies jumped 34% after the company, which helps people buy and sell homes online, said it hired Shopify’s chief operating officer, Kaz Nejatian, as its CEO. It also announced a $40 million investment in the company by one of its founders and an investment firm tied to another founder.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes ticked higher after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at its latest meeting. The European bank is on pause following an earlier set of cuts, and its president, Christine Lagarde, said future moves are “not on a predetermined path.”\nFrance’s CAC 40 rose 0.8%, and Germany’s DAX returned 0.3%.\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. Stocks jumped 1.7% in Shanghai but fell 0.4% in Hong Kong.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.02% from 4.04% late Wednesday.\n___\nAP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."

            "EU leaders defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide future ahead of Trump-Putin summit. EU leaders made a rallying call to defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide its own future in advance of their virtual summit with Donald Trump – convened to discuss US strategy before the president’s talks with Vladimir Putin on Friday.\nWith the exception of Hungary, all EU leaders signed a joint statement, with Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, also calling for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to attend the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on Friday.\nTrump insists his meeting with Putin is a “feel-out” to gauge the Russian leader’s willingness to compromise, but European leaders fear Trump will be lured into a joint declaration with Moscow that involves irretrievable concessions before substantive talks between Ukraine and Russia.\nPutin may also use the meeting to advance a wider agenda of normalisation of relations between the US and Russia, a development that would start to lock Trump into economic cooperation with Moscow rather than confrontation.\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Tuesday that the summit would be a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin, and that it would take place in Anchorage, Alaska. She further lowered expectations for any kind of agreement, saying that it would be a “listening exercise” for Trump.\nZelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out removing Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region, probably a key aim for Russia, and described the summit as a “victory” for Putin. “First, he will meet on US territory, which I consider his personal victory,” Zelenskyy said. “Second, he is coming out of isolation because he is meeting on US territory. Third, with this meeting, he has somehow postponed sanctions.”\nEurope has also vocally backed Ukraine. The EU leaders said on Tuesday: “Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” adding: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.\n“A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees.” They added that EU nations were ready to contribute further to security guarantees.\nThe Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, Putin’s longstanding ally in Europe, mocked the statement from his EU counterparts, saying: “The statement attempts to set conditions for a meeting to which leaders of the EU were not invited. The fact that the EU was left on the sidelines is sad enough as it is. The only thing that could make things worse is if we started providing instructions from the bench.” Denying he was Putin’s puppet, he added: “The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the US-Russia meeting.”\nZelenskyy said there was no sign of Russia seeking peace, and said it was instead preparing a fresh military offensive. Ukraine admitted it was trying to prevent a decisive Russian breakthrough in the north of the Donetsk region.\nEuropean leaders are clinging to the hope that Trump’s recent impatience with Putin for failing to agree a 30-day ceasefire will not dissolve on contact with the Russian leader. Recent signs suggested Trump was slowly hardening his stance towards Russia, including resuming intelligence cooperation with Ukraine, a willingness to supply arms for Ukraine if bought by the EU and the threat of secondary sanctions against countries that traded in Russian oil.\nBut Europe’s painstaking diplomatic progress with Trump, including a successful Nato summit in June, now looks to be at risk.\nTrump has said any peace deal would involve “some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine, a phrasing that hides the reality that virtually all the territory in question is Ukrainian. Russia has yet to specify if it will hand back any of the territory it has seized by force since it launched its first military attacks more than 11 years ago.\n“Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” the European leaders said. They added: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.”\nKallas added: “The sequencing of the steps is important. First, an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees.”\nIn the statement early on Tuesday, the leaders were careful not to express criticism of Trump, saying they welcomed “the efforts of President Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”.\nThey added: “A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force.”\nTrump played down the possibility of a breakthrough in Alaska but said he anticipated “constructive conversations” with Putin, a piece of expectation management that is unlikely to reassure European leaders.\n“This is really a feel-out meeting a little bit,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’re going to see what he has in mind and if it’s a fair deal, I’ll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to Nato leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,” Trump said. “I may say: ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting.’ Or I may say: ‘We can make a deal.’”\nTrump was also critical of Zelenskyy on Monday, noting that Ukraine’s leader had been in power for the duration of the war and said “nothing happened” during that time. He has made it clear that he sees no prospect of Ukraine regaining territory it has lost, and is frustrated that European leaders, worried about Ukrainian morale, remain so reluctant to acknowledge this reality in public. Zelenskyy refers to a de facto loss of territory, but will refuse to accept the loss in any peace treaty.",
            "Streetwise Professor » 2022 » February. To the surprise of many, including to some extent me, the Russian assault on Ukraine has bogged down. But that’s probably not the right phrasing. It was never unbogged. It has made very little progress in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, and this was true from the opening moments of the assault.\nThe biggest surprise to me is that Russia has not been able to secure anything remotely approaching air superiority. On paper, they should dominate. But they have lost many aircraft, including not just ground attack SU-25s (which are pretty vulnerable) but also front line Sukhoi fighters and IL-76 transport aircraft (presumably loaded with airborne troopers, Russia’s best). Their main air attacks on Kiev have apparently used cruise missiles, which suggests concerns about the risks Ukrainian air defenses pose to Russian manned aircraft.\nThe first hours–days, actually–of a US assault would have been focused on dismantling the air defense system. (Remember the first 100 hours of Desert Storm.). Once that is achieved, the tanks roll. The Russians have done both simultaneously (perhaps for political reasons) and it is not working out for them.\nOn the ground, gains are apparently few, and achieved at high cost at places like Kharkiv/Kharkov. (Even though Ukraine probably has no von Mansteins in charge.) I thought Mariupol would fall pretty quickly, but the Russians appear to be more interested in moving east along the coast rather than securing the rest of Donetsk–which was ostensibly the pretext for this crime.\nIt seems that the Russian plan was to execute a coup de main to seize Kiev/Kyiv using airborne units and special forces (Alfa/Spetsnaz). They have not achieved that. They seized, then lost, then seized again an airport near Kiev that would have been the springboard for that. But damage to the runways and the losses of some planes that would ferry in the follow on forces have delayed that, and possibly scuppered it. Reports indicate that the VDV units are instead moving to Kiev/Kyiv overland from Belarus.\nSome special forces units–in Ukrainian uniforms–have been killed and captured. (Here is an example from Nikopol.). Not a good look for the alleged elite. (Not a good look because of poor operational performance, and because of the violation of the rules of war: the Ukrainians had every right to shoot them on sight. But maybe they could serve as very effective weapons in the propaganda war.)\nThere are stories of some Russian penetrations into Kiev/Kyiv, but Zelensky is still there and the Ukrainians appear to be in control of the bulk of the capital.\nFailure to execute a lightning strike that toppled the Ukrainian government now presents Putin with a grim choice. He obviously believes Kyiv/Kiev/the Ukrainian government is the center of gravity in this conflict. The failure of a decapitation strike against the Ukrainian government confronts Putin with the prospect of a protracted battle in the streets of the capital. Urban warfare is slow and bloody, a meat grinder par excellence.\nThe historical Russian approach to such battles is to use overwhelming firepower (cf. Berlin 1945, or more recently Grozny). But Putin supposedly venerates Kiev as the cradle of Russian civilization, and reveres St. Vladimir (a prince of Kiev) as “as the unifier and defender of Russian lands, as a visionary politician.” Will he subject this holy place to the Grozny treatment if Ukrainians (soldiers and civilians alike) fight his soldiers in the streets?\nThe cost in lives–including Russian lives–of such a choice would be immense. The financial burden on Russia of sustaining a high intensity conflict would also be acute. And making such a choice would almost certainly lead to the imposition of the most severe economic sanctions against Russia, namely its excision from the world financial system via expulsion from SWIFT and sanctioning of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. This would no doubt set off some intense political dynamics within Russia.\nPutin was counting on a short, decisive, victorious war. With every passing minute, it becomes clearer that he won’t get it.\nWhat then, Vova?\nGiven that he is quite likely mentally unbalanced–severely so–that question is as fraught for us as it is for him.\nSo why hasn’t the supposed juggernaut juggered?\nWell, for one thing, the enemy gets a vote. (More on that in a bit.)\nFor another, Russia’s performance in Georgia in 2008 was something of an embarrassment to Putin and Russia. In its aftermath Russia embarked on a wholesale shakeup of the military, involving substantial investment in new equipment (not just tanks, planes, and the like, but things like radios) and an attempt to reform the manpower system.\nFrom the outside–and here I and others likely fell for Russian information operations–the changes appeared to be working. The Russian army was not the shambolic wreck it had been. But it is clearly not the juggernaut it presented itself to be.\nFrom the outset one question in my mind was not the hardware, but the meatware. I wrote a lot 10 years or so ago about the Russian military manpower problem. The military had become less reliant on conscripts, but the conscript cycle had become shortened to a single year, meaning that many of the soldiers currently violating Ukrainian soil have been in the army only a few months–hardly likely to be effective fighters. Just how this new mix would respond to contact with the enemy was much harder to evaluate than the change in Russian materiel. The initial results are not impressive.\nAnd it must also be noted that Ukraine also engaged in a crash reform of its military post-2014. Its performance has been far more credible than most expected. Thus, if anything, it appears that the Ukrainian military reforms over the last 8 years have been more effective than Russia’s over the last 14. Indeed, the Ukrainians have demonstrated considerable pluck, with numerous incidents (telling a Russian ship to “go fuck yourself” when the ship demanded their surrender, a soldier sacrificing himself to blow up a bridge in the faces of advancing Russians) that will build a legend of national resistance. (This in turn would make any putative Russian occupation all the more difficult.)\nInitial reports (which must always be treated with care) indicate the the Russians are already facing serious logistical difficulties. If true, this is gobsmacking. If you can’t support a campaign on your own doorstep, you may be a colossus, but you have logistical feet of clay. This is especially true since the Russians had considerable time to plan and prepare, lay in stocks, etc.\nAnd their logistical difficulties will only get worse. It is axiomatic that the further the advance, the more logistical friction impairs operational effectiveness.\nAnd supply lines present the Ukrainians with a perfect opportunity to turn the asymmetric warfare table on the Russians. Partisan warfare against invaders has long been a speciality of Ukrainians, whether it be against the Red Army in the Civil War, the Germans in WWII, or the Soviets in the aftermath of WWII. Tanks can’t move without gas. Soldiers can’t fight without food. Detaching units to hunt down guerrillas erodes combat power.\nIn sum, Putin wanted and expected–and in fact, absolutely needed–a quick victory. It is increasingly likely that he will not get it. Another example of “no plan survives contact with the enemy.”\nOn the one hand, that is encouraging–although Ukraine will pay a high price in a protracted conflict. But we have to ponder how Putin will respond to a stalemate, or a long slog towards victory.\nPutin tells a story from his youth in which he cornered a rat–to his regret (Putin’s, not the rat’s). Maybe it happened. Maybe it didn’t. But he tells it to send a message: if you corner me I will try to rip off your face.\nHe justifies his invasion of Ukraine as a legitimate act of self-defense because the US and Nato had backed him into a corner. That was a grotesque exaggeration, but he may well find himself in a corner in Ukraine.\nOne response to stalemate is to escalate. As Eisenhower said, “If you can’t solve a problem, enlarge it.” But if Putin’s military proves itself to be a brittle sword, what other means does he have to escalate? The answer to that question is obvious–and ominous. Especially when one considers Russian nuclear doctrine.",
            "Streetwise Professor » Ukraine. I was about to write that Europe has lost its mind, but I’m starting to wonder whether it had anything to lose. The meltdown over Trump having the audacity–the temerity!–to try to end the war in Ukraine (or at least bring a respite to the fighting) continues apace. Indeed, it seems to ramp up daily.\nOne common response to the US insistence that Europe put on its big boy pants and provide for its own defense is to say that well, if the US is going to abandon Europe, Europe should ally with China. Now, many of those saying so are just online midwits and dimwits, but not all of them. Indeed, the UK deep state’s preferred think tank, Chatham House, is flogging the idea:\nHow is this supposed to work, actually? China is going to protect Europe against Russia? You know, the Russia that is in an alliance with China, and which China provides much of the support necessary to keep the war in Ukraine going on? That Russia? Will China base troops in Europe to defend against Russia? Oh, and is China going to put Europe under its nuclear umbrella . . . to deter a nuclear attack by Russia?\nSo please do tell: just how is China going to replace what the US has provided Europe for the past 80 years?\nI’ve heard idiotic ideas in my time, but this is in the running for the most idiotic.\nBecause it’s not a rational response. Instead, it is adolescent petulance, along the lines of: “Daddy is forcing me to support myself. I’ll show him! I’ll go down on the local fentanyl dealer!”\nGo for it. I’m sure that will be awesome, and that China will respect you in the morning!\nEurope is also making moves to strengthen its military.\nSo even if Germany does defy my expectations and buy some armaments, they won’t have anybody to fight using them. Maybe they’ll buy robots (from Tesla?) with voices like Arnold in Terminator to operate them.\nFrance’s Henery Hawk, AKA Manny Macron, is acting very butch. He is flying the French version of AWACS over the Black Sea, pretending it can replace the intel the US is providing. A portion, boy, only a portion.\nBut Macron has inadvertently given away Europe’s real motive for not wanting the war in Ukraine to end:\nThat is, if fighting stops in Ukraine, Putin will move on to attack other countries, so the fighting must go on. In other words, Europe wants to fight to the last Ukrainian because they are petrified at their own impotence. All the while camouflaging their cynicism with lofty statements about protecting Ukrainian sovereignty.\nThe Baltics, in particular Estonia, have also been very vocal in their demands that “let’s you and him fight to protect me.”\nVery revealing. Though as I’ve said repeatedly, if you look at capabilities, their fears are vastly overblown.\nAnd as for the last Ukrainian, it is not hyperbole to say that Ukraine would be a dying nation even without this war. Europe as a whole is a demographic nightmare, and Ukraine is the most nightmarish country of them all:\nThat 23.8 million forecast decline represents 61 percent of Ukraine’s current population. 61 percent.\nTo put it bluntly: why should the US, or Europe for that matter, fight Putin over what will soon be a corpse? And why should the US, and the rest of Nato, shackle itself to what is soon to be a corpse, and promise to go to war (under Article 5) to protect it? That didn’t work out well for Germany in WWI with Austria-Hungary.\nTo me the most telling sign of Putin’s malignity is that he is willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of Russians to take control of a terminally ill nation. Especially in light of Russia’s own demographic train wreck, which looks good only in comparison with Ukraine (and some other eastern European nations, notably Poland).\nSo will hostilities cease soon despite Europe’s wish that they continue? I don’t know, but I can say that Europe’s desires matter not at all, except if they feed Zelensky’s delusions sufficiently to make him to reject reality and refuse any compromise.\nZelensky has–after being reminded through the limited withdrawal of US support of his dependence on America–agreed to the cease fire plan offered by Trump. Putin has publicly said that he will agree too . . . with conditions. In response to which the cry has gone up “See–he isn’t interested! It was dumb to expect otherwise! Why does Trump even bother? It must be because he’s Putin’s poodle!”\nSaid by people who apparently don’t understand that public statements–especially by the likes of Putin–must be discounted heavily. What matters is what transpires out of view. Trump and Putin will supposedly speak this week. That’s what matters, though the usual bedwetters are saying that this only proves that Trump is Putin’s stooge.\nMethinks their real fear is that Trump will bring the fighting to an end, at least for a while.\nPutin needs a deal, for many reasons. But he has proven that he is willing to expend lives to gain some concessions. Europe and the foreign policy establishment in the US refuse to countenance any such concessions, including in particular a denial of Nato membership for Ukraine.\nBut that is a price that the US should be more than willing to pay: indeed, Biden should have offered it in 2021 or 2022, in which case the war might well never have begun in the first place. Again, shackling the US to a Ukrainian corpse-to-be would be all pain and no gain for the US.\nIf that’s a hill the Europeans want to die on (or more accurately, want the Ukrainians to die on), so be it. The US should not be party to their folly, and their selfish cynicism.\nThe Europeans are making quite a spectacle of themselves. After years of bashing Trump for daring to demand that they pay for their own defense, they are now freaking out at the prospect that the US is over their mooching. They are alternating between shrieking at Trump for betraying the sacred alliance with Europe and making bold promises to do what Trump has been demanding for years (and which even Obama demanded before that, though less vituperously)–namely, pay for their own damned defense.\nThe European performance over recent months has reminded me of the rich brat who lives off dad’s largesse, living a nice hippie life with no responsibility, all the while calling dad a Nazi racist imperialist capitalist. Then daddy has enough, and says it’s time for him to get to work and support himself–and to STFU. Which causes the brat to have a breakdown and throw a fit. “Daddy is a big meanie! How dare he cut me off!” As if that’s going to change dad’s mind. If anything, it’s going to confirm dad’s conviction to be shed of the brat. And probably give him a swift kick in the ass on the way out the door.\nOne manifestation of this European brattishness is their fawning over Zelensky, who has also felt daddy’s wrath. “The bad man was mean to you! We can relate! Let’s have a big group hug! We’ll support you! You can count on us!”\nFor his part, Zelensky obviously prefers European tongue baths to Trump tongue lashings, so he has been meeting all of the European bigwigs, you know, from countries like Portugal and Slovenia, collecting promises of undying support. (He should interpret the word “undying” to mean “we support you but we aren’t going to die for you”).\nThis is all utterly delusional. Europe cannot come close to making up for what the US provides Ukraine. On Tuesday I wondered aloud whether the US would withdraw intelligence information from Ukraine. This is vital to Ukraine and Europe is utterly incapable of filling that breach.\nOn Wednesday it did, and Starlink is apparently on the cutting block.\nBut no worries! The Europeans will replace Starlink with their totes awesome Eutelstat system!\nLater Kellogg induced a continent-wide case of the vapors when he said “It’s like hitting a mule in the face with a two by four, you know. You got their attention.”\nBut apparently not, because Zelensky is still resisting reality, and the Europeans are encouraging him in his delusions that he can fight on without fulsome US support but with European backing.\nThe Europeans are putting on a brave front, promising to throw hundreds of billions at rearming. Although it’s nice for them to put a price tag on what the US has been giving them for decades, this is yet another delusion.\nGermany, under its not yet Chancellor Merz, is moving to break its self-imposed budgetary restrictions in order to splurge on weapons. The EU, France, Germany, and some others are talking of funding a European military. Along with the UK, France is advocating sending troops to Ukraine–despite the fact that Russia has said that it will not countenance this, and that this supposedly stirring commitment is tied to US participation in some form, which is another non-starter.\nMacron (who reminds me of Henery Hawk from Looney Tunes) is particularly manic, promising to extend the French nuclear umbrella to the rest of Europe.\nIn brief, Europe is having a manic moment. However, I predict that when they come down from their mania, reality will kick in and they will lapse back into their lotus eater lethargy.\nThe practical obstacles are numerous. First, and most notably, this will force Europe to choose between guns and butter, or more precisely, guns and welfare, pensions, etc. They have time and time again demonstrated what choice they make, and it ain’t guns.\nMoreover, especially in the land of King Henery I (he of the 13 percent approval rating who was soundly rejected in the last election–last two, actually), budgetary realities make even a small splurge on armaments unaffordable. And indeed, Henery’s finance minister has already signaled that France will fade the bid:\n“Early stages of planning.” Yeah, those Leclerc tanks and Caesar SP guns will be rolling off the assembly lines any minute now!\nEurope says it’s ramping up its defenses. The ramp’s slope is about 1/10th of a degree.\nAnother reality is that those making the biggest noise have a track record. Ursula von der Leyen, for example.\nAnother reality. EU decisions have to be unanimous. Hungary and Slovakia will certainly not go along with a European army, or especially with EU military intervention in Ukraine. And other countries have expressed reservations, along the lines that defense is a national issue, not a collective European one.\nPerhaps France and Germany, with an assist from pipsqueaks like the belligerent Baltics, will try to dragoon the rest of the EU to comply with their demands. But if they do, the most likely outcome would be to shatter the EU. And wouldn’t that be ironic? The Europeans stridently claim that Trump is destroying Nato, and they are on a path to destroy the EU.\nAs an aside, this demonstrates exactly why I have long argued that the willy-nilly expansion of Nato, especially post-1999 was foolish. The more heterogeneous and numerous the participants in an alliance, the less capable it is to take action, especially if a decision to do so must be unanimous. But Europe has had a panting desire to collect the whole set. Be careful what you wish for.\nIn sum, all of the practical, political, and budgetary realities that Europe now faces militate against their fulfillment of their bold promises to bulk up.\nAnd I don’t know who is a bigger fool for not recognizing this–the Europeans or Zelensky. The former can be excused somewhat, for despite their bed wetting they don’t face an existential threat from Russia or anybody else. Zelensky does, yet between this massive little man ego and his desperation to stay in power (which could literally be existential as well as lucrative) he has chosen to seek succor from those who can’t provide it, and spurn the one who can.\nI find the European attacks on Trump and the US to be sickly amusing.\nOne is that “the US needs allies!!!” Uhm, we need them in Asia, and there countries with a grip on reality (notably Japan) are stepping up: Europe can do fuck all for us there. We don’t need them in Europe, because frankly (interesting word in this context!) Europe is now secondary or even tertiary when it comes to US national interest. And we especially don’t need free loading allies–which the Europeans have been.\nAnother is that the US is appeasing Russia, and repeating the mistake of Munich, 1938. Uhm, no, for multiple reasons. Most importantly, in terms of capability–which is what matters–Putin’s Russia is not Hitler’s Germany. Geography also matters–a Germany located in the heart of Europe is a totally different problem than a Russia on its far eastern periphery. Those whose stock of historical metaphors is limited to Munich should not be taken seriously, or paid attention to at all.\nThen there are some pompous types who claim Trump’s geopolitical calculations are naive:\nWhere to begin? Perhaps this is one part of Trump’s rationale, but it is hardly the most important one. The overriding one is that regardless of what one thinks of Putin and Russia, it is not in the American national interest to get into a war with them–not even a proxy war that absorbs relatively modest resources, let alone a full-out conflict. It is certainly not in American national interest to get into a conflict over Ukraine, sorry. The US (and Europe!) survived for decades when Ukraine was part of a much more dangerous adversary, the USSR. Russia is a declining power that cannot decisively defeat a never was power with 1/5th its population and less than 1/5th of its economy. And if the Europeans can’t deal with that, well that’s a fate they’ve chosen.\nAmerica’s preeminent interests are now in Asia, and China is the only adversary that matters right now. Getting bogged down in a war in eastern Europe severely constrains the US’s ability to respond to that threat. Kellogg made this point explicitly:\nI’m reminded of what Professor Paul Kennedy from Yale University wrote in a seminal work, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, when he noted that great powers historically fail when they involve themselves in strategic overreach. He called it imperial overreach. But I’ll make it simple so you don’t have to buy the book. When a nation is concerned about filling somebody else’s potholes when they have their own potholes, they fail.\nIf a peace in Ukraine (even a flawed one, as almost all peaces are) and something of a rapprochement with Russia does help cleave Russia from China, that’s gravy. It’s not the main course.\nEurope is living in a fantasy land. Trump is hitting them with a reality stick but that has just caused them to invent new fantasies. And Zelensky is buying into them.\nThat’s their choice. Let them live with it, or die with it as the case may be (especially for Zelensky). We have business elsewhere.\nYesterday morning I was composing a post in my head, to the effect that Zelensky had come to Washington to sign a deal that would give Trump the justification for continuing to provide US funds (and weapons) to Ukraine.\nThen yesterday afternoon happened. Get me rewrite!\nI won’t give the blow-by-blow. If you are reading this you’ve probably already seen several of those. So I’ll just give some reactions and analysis.\nThe basic conclusion: it was the most idiotic play I’ve ever seen by a national leader in public. Ever. I mean, screwed the pooch doesn’t even come close to describing it.\nOne administration person said “Zelensky didn’t read the room.” That’s totally wrong. Zelensky acted like he didn’t even know what fucking room he was in. He was in the American White House, with the American president and vice president, in public.\nYou don’t talk smack about someone in their house with the world watching. Especially is that someone is notoriously thin-skinned and not that well-disposed to you to begin with. (In fact, the bigger the asshole you consider Trump to be, the dumber Zelensky’s stunt has to look). And especially especially if that thin-skinned host holds your fate in his hands. And you don’t wrangle an invitation under false pretenses, as Zelensky did, by claiming that he was there to sign a deal.\nTrump has one overriding objective: to stop the fighting. That’s not enough for Zelensky. He repeatedly emphasized that he wants total victory (meaning return of all territories lost since 2014) and security guarantees including Nato membership and US troops in Ukraine.\nThese things are not in his opportunity set. Not even within hailing distance of his opportunity set. Hell, you can’t see them with the James Webb telescope from where he is.\nZelensky kept emphasizing that Putin started it, that Putin is evil, etc., etc., etc. Which means absolutely fuck all even if totally true (which I believe it is).\nIn the real world–which Zelensky does not inhabit–cosmic justice is unattainable. Deals with the devil are frequently the best of bad alternatives. Half loaves are preferable to none.\nThis is why Trump repeatedly told Zelensky he didn’t have the cards to play. This is a home truth, and one that the administration has expressed repeatedly in private, but which Zelensky refuses to accept.\nZelensky and his European and American enablers remind me of the heads of belligerent governments in WWI. They all–all–believed the other side was evil, and was to blame for the war. As a result, they utterly refused to countenance anything but total victory. Though the rational thing to do once stalemate arrived on the western front in late-1914 would have been to negotiate an agreement that would have satisfied no one, they fought on and on and on.\nDue to their obduracy, millions died and nations and empires collapsed. And that process and dying did not end in November 1918 or even in June 1919 at Versailles. It kinda sorta ended (but not completely) in May 1945.\nWhat’s more, Zelensky wants a Versailles-like diktat imposed on Russia, including reparations. (He reacted enthusiastically to a question suggesting that Russia pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine).\nPutting aside the wisdom of such a diktat (didn’t work out well for the Allies post-1919, did it?), only a total victor is in a position to impose one. And there is no universe in which that is happening today.\nSo Zelensky came to DC under false pretenses to make impossible demands, threw a fit when he was told–at first very politely–that they were impossible, and kept up the fit until he made it necessary for first Vance and then Trump to smack him down. And even then he was rude–interrupting, calling Vance by his initials, rolling his eyes, crossing his arms in highly passive aggressive body language, etc.\nFrankly, he got off lucky. Trump and Vance would have been perfectly justified in bitch slapping him silly.\nWhatever capital he had had with this administration, he lit on fire. Marco Rubio, not a hot tempered type, was obviously furious and at the end of his rope:\nI have never seen the man so amped up, let alone for 18 plus minutes straight.\nEven Ukraine’s biggest fanboi is over him:\nAll of which is why this was the most self-destructive performance by a national leader that I have ever seen or read about in history. The only way to conclude that Zelensky behaved intelligently is to believe that he wants to self-destruct. Because that’s what he did.\nOf course the Europeans immediately rallied to console him. “Oh poor boy! Were those brutes mean to you? Mommy is here for you!”\nAnd maybe that’s Zelensky’s problem–he really believes that. Another reality that appears to escape him is that the Europeans are as useless as tits on a bull. (Ditto if he was playing to the US press, which was the biggest loser of the 2024 election).\nActually, they are worse. They feed his delusions.\nThose Europeans-Macron and Starmer-who have pledged troops for Ukraine came to DC and made it plain that pledge would vanish without US troops on the ground. Which ain’t happening. I further note that even the European pie crust promises are conditional on a cease fire, which can only be obtained on terms that Zelensky has rejected.\nWhy are the Europeans so afraid that Trump is pushing for a cease fire that will not result in Russia’s total defeat? Looking at their public statements, it appears that they are afraid that if that does not happen, Putin will invade their welfare states and plant the Russian flag (or maybe the Soviet one!) on the English Channel, the Bay of Biscay, and the North Sea.\nI’ve seen bedwetters before, but this takes the prize. If anything, the war in Ukraine should put such fears to rest, not stoke them. At most the war might say something about Putin’s dreams or intentions of conquest. But it clearly shows that his capabilities to pose any threat to Europe are completely lacking.\nAt best, Russia is able to make advances of a few kilometers here and there over a front of a couple of hundred clicks against an undermanned and under-firepowered foe. Advances on foot, mind you. Russia’s armor has been all but annihilated. Most of the front is inactive and static because the Russians cannot muster enough force to do anything except make very narrow advances.\nAnd let’s not forget. If the Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered European nightmares of Soviet advances in 1944 and 1945, those advances were completely dependent on American trucks. Russia has no comparable logistic capabilities today.\nEven at the beginning of this fiasco, Russian logistics were shambolic due in large part to very basic problems–like shoddy Chinese tires that blew out after minimal use on bad roads. And those were the glory days! Look now–Russians are using civilian cars and vans, including old Ladas, to transport troops and supplies to the front lines. They have even resorted to donkeys.\nNote that the Russians cannot even sustain enough combat power to retake the Kursk bulge on Russian territory.\nFears of Russian military might were overstated in 2022. (Even the vaunted Battalion Tactical Groups–which were obliterated in short order–were optimized for defense; which is perhaps why they failed in the offense). Putin fooled the Europeans (and a lot of Americans) with Potemkin military “reforms.” Anyone who harbors such illusions now is beyond help.\nSpeaking of the Europeans, a European think tank estimated that it would cost ~$250 billion/year to replace America’s contribution to European defense. Thanks for that estimate of the amount by which we have been subsidizing those free riders for the past 8 decades.\nThe bottom line is this. Continuing the war in Ukraine is not in American interests. Ending the war is. The president of the United States has the responsibility of advancing American interests. By trying to end the war, even under conditions that do not achieve cosmic justice, and allow an evil actor to pocket some gains and live to be evil in the future, Trump is advancing American interests.\nBut if he succeeds, he is advancing Ukrainian interests too. Perhaps most of all. This war is destroying that nation and its people, and its continuation will only increase the destruction. Zelensky thinks that recovering blasted regions is in his nation’s interest, regardless of the cost. In that way, he is as much an enemy of the Ukrainian people as Putin.\nThe breathtaking expansiveness of Trump’s demands (apparently trimmed back subsequent to that article) is the real story here. Writing that Trump is an idiot because there aren’t ackshually any rare earths in Ukraine totally misses it.\nWhy does Trump emphasize rare earths? Who knows for sure, but I have some ideas.\nOne is typical Trump kayfabe, “presenting staged performances as genuine or authentic” (in professional wrestling mainly, but a staple of the Trump method). Rare earths are in the news, primarily because of Chinese dominance thereof. (Not, by the way, because China is uniquely endowed with them, but because the US and the West have outsourced the intensely polluting refining process to China, which has a far higher tolerance for industrial pollution). Although a lot of people know that rare earths aren’t rare, and may know that Ukraine doesn’t have any, that’s not common knowledge. By broadcasting that he’s going to get America’s hands on something commonly perceived to be extremely valuable, Trump can sell his base on continued support for Ukraine despite his early promises to cut it loose.\nEither way, by taking Trump literally Blas et al are failing to note what they should be taking seriously. Which probably doesn’t bother Trump one bit–and wouldn’t if either of my conjectures that rare earths are a blind or a feint are correct.\nFor his part, Zelensky reacted with outrage. Never! Colonialism!\nAt least in public. Marco Rubio–seconded by J.D. Vance–called out Zelensky publicly for duplicity.\nThis surprises me not in the least, but it makes me question yet again Zelensky’s intelligence (in the sense of IQ, not information). Arguing with Trump and exchanging insults with him in public on this and other issues (notably the negotiations with Russia) is an incredibly stupid strategy for someone whose fate largely rests in Trump’s hands.\nIndeed, the more you think that Trump is an asshole who hates Zelensky, and is looking to sell Ukraine down the river, the more you have to agree that Zelensky should keep his mouth shut, and definitely should not wave a red cape at a raging bull president. Being two-faced with Trump is a recipe for getting both of them ripped off. Or if you are going to be two faced, display the nice one in public and the mean one in private, rather than the reverse as Zelensky is doing.\nIt would be particularly stupid of Zelensky to pick a fight over non-existent rare earths. Sure Donald, the rare earths are yours! He’d be giving up nothing and potentially gaining something. Picking a fight over nothing is beyond stupid. (That fact alone should have the ackshually crowd questioning whether it’s rare earths that Trump is ackshually after).\nIt’s really mystifying what Zelensky think he’s accomplishing here. Playing up to the Europeans? Since they are utterly impotent and can’t protect him (not to mention that many including Scholz and Poland have expressed publicly an unwillingness to do so) that would be incredibly foolish. Playing to the anti-Trump element in the US? Equally foolish because at present they are even more impotent than the Europeans.\nMaybe it’s just exhaustion or a psychological breakdown, either of which would be understandable given the strain he’s been under for the last three plus years. Or maybe he wants out of a hopeless situation and is creating a pretext for his ouster. Or maybe he’s just an arrogant idiot.\nAs for the substance of a US-Ukraine deal over Ukrainian resources (other than rare earths), Rubio brings up a point I made several weeks ago on X. Namely, giving the US a major stake in Ukraine would serve as a far more credible bond to secure continued American protection than pie crust promises. Major skin in the Ukrainian game vis a vis Russia aligns American and Ukrainian interests far better than any alternative.\nThat is not complicated. An American stake produces time consistency. “Commitments”–promises to do things in the future on Ukraine’s behalf–are not time consistent because there would be little cost of reneging on those commitments in the future. You know, sort of like the Budapest Memorandum. You’d think Zelensky would have learned from that experience. Apparently not.\nI assert that a major economic stake in Ukraine’s economy would be a far better guarantor of Ukraine’s security than membership in Nato. There is no reason to believe that Nato would not fade Article 5 commitments in the event of a future Russian incursion or subversion.\nThis is especially true when dealing with a relentlessly transactional man like Trump.\nBesides, 50 percent of something is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing. Which is what Ukraine will have if the US walks.\nThere is considerable room for skepticism about Trump’s approach to Ukraine. But that skepticism should be grounded in something other than snickering about Trump’s supposed rare earth delusions. And for Zelensky turn his comedic talents to insult comedy is suicidal.\nLast week marked the 1000th dreary day of the Russo-Ukrainian War. It also saw a new, and disturbing, phase in the conflict.\nSpecifically, the Biden Administration (not the non compos mentis Biden, of course, but some shadowy cabal of aides) granted permission to Ukraine to utilize Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) to attack targets on some Russian territory, specifically Kursk oblast and environs. In response, the Russians launched a nuclear capable experimental intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) into Ukraine: the missile was topped with six non-nuclear (and in fact non-explosive) warheads.\nIn many respects the western response to Russia’s launch was overwrought. It was obviously a signal of escalation dominance that reminded me of Crocodile Dundee and the knife:\n“That’s not a missile. That’s a missile.” I see your tactical missile and raise you a ballistic missile. I call.\nRegardless of the merits of unleashing the ATACMs (which I will discuss below) it was utterly irresponsible for a lame duck administration to do so. It will not have to deal with the consequences. The incoming Trump administration will. And it can only complicate Trump’s already daunting task in Ukraine. Given how clearly disruptive this move was, it could only have been undertaken with malign intent. An “if we can’t rule, nobody will,” spiteful decision.\nRegarding the merits. On the one hand ATACMs do not represent a substantial escalation: Ukraine has for months launched attacks on Russia using drones, and on soil Russia has claimed its own (notably Crimea) using various western-made cruise missiles. However, and ironically, by previously pointedly refusing to permit the use of ATACMs on targets in Russia the administration effectively deferred to Putin’s declaration that doing so would cross a red line. Thus, the volte face can only be interpreted as a deliberate flouting of said line, and therefore a deliberate escalation.\nAnd for what? ATACMs, especially in the limited numbers that the US has supplied to Ukraine, cannot have a decisive effect on the war. (Nor can Storm Shadows, or SCALPs, or Taureses, or JASSMs). At most they can disrupt to some degree Russian logistics (e.g., by blowing up munitions depots) or command and control (by striking headquarters). (The fact that the administration made this argument to justify its previous denial of permission for using ATACMs in Russia demonstrates that it recent reversal was an act of spite rather than a reasoned military judgment).\nBut Ukraine’s military problems so fundamental that inconveniencing Russian operations in these ways will not be decisive.\nUkraine’s first fundamental problem is manpower. Yes, Russia is suffering far larger casualties, but the bloody minded Putin has shown his willingness to tolerate them, and Russia can absorb them far more readily than Ukraine.\nUkraine’s second fundamental problem is air defense, which has both a tactical and a strategic dimension. Tactically, after almost two years of complete ineffectualness, the Russian air forces finally found a way to influence the battle zone by dropping large numbers of FAB glide bombs (some weighing 3 metric tons) on Ukrainian positions from beyond the range of Ukrainian air defenses. Yes, ATACMs can be used to strike the airfields hosting the SU-34s that drop the bombs, thereby forcing the Russians to base them further away and reducing the number of sorties they can launch, but this effect is at the margins. Strategically, through drones and missiles (like iskander, which is more capable than ATACMs) Russia has devastated Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Whether Ukraine can survive another winter of concerted attacks on its power grid is debatable.\nZelensky has been screaming for more anti-aircraft missile systems (especially Patriots) and some have been forthcoming, especially from Europe. But the need far outstrips the capacity of the US to provide more.\nThe problems are myriad. The underlying problem is that old Soviet habits die hard. Most notably, command is overly centralized, leading to slow responses to battlefield crises, and a shocking indifference to information coming from those on the front lines.\nThe centralization has also led to an extremely defective organizational structure. The Ukrainian army has brigades which control battalions, but it has no divisions that control brigades, or corps that control divisions.\nSupposedly because divisions are too expensive. Getting brigades and battalions destroyed due to command and control problems isn’t?\nThe lack of divisions leads to poor coordination between adjacent brigades, and the Russians have learned to exploit these seams. (Seams between units are always a vulnerability. Multiplying the seams multiplies the vulnerabilities). Moreover, Syrski et al control the brigades and even battalions directly, and shuttle them around willy-nilly in response to the latest front line crisis. This has created numerous opportunities that the Russians have exploited, for example by attacking when a new unit is shuffled into line without adequate preparation, or by putting units with no communication channels next to one another, making coordinated response to Russian attacks almost impossible.\nWhen you see reports of this brigade or that being in some place, it is often not an intact brigade, but just a few battalions (and sometimes only one) from that brigade. Meaning that Ukrainian lines are held by jumbles of units controlled (or pretended to be controlled) by generals in Kyiv with minimal operational awareness. It makes the (often exaggerated) Chateau Generalship of World War I look good by comparison.\nThe Ukrainian command has also exhibited at times a Hitleresque (or Stalinesque) tendency to demand that units fight to the last and not withdraw when caught in an untenable situation, leading to pointless casualties (including the loss of prisoners who are executed by the Russians). This is particularly disastrous when manpower is in precious short supply–as it is.\nUkraine’s only saving grace is that Russian command is even more incompetent. The difference is that Russia has the material resources to compensate for this incompetence. Ukraine does not.\nUkraine has also made some incomprehensible decisions on how to allocate its scarce resource. Most notably, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the Russian prepared defenses (and in particular the use of heavy minefields) in stopping the much vaunted but failed Ukrainian counteroffensive of 2023 (the Surovkin Line), time and again Ukraine has failed to fortify obvious targets of Russian offensives.\nSo as it is, Ukraine is barely hanging on. It’s not losing yet, but it certainly is not winning. And definitely not by Zelensky’s definition of victory: regaining all occupied Ukrainian territory. That is the pipe dream to end all pipe dreams.\nYet he insists on it.\nThe situation now is that both sides need an end to the fighting, but neither is willing to acknowledge it. Ukraine’s dire circumstances are evident, and although Russia’s aren’t quite so dire, they are bad, and the cost Russia is incurring is certainly not worth the possible gain–adding another string of shitholes to Putin’s collection. Eastern Ukraine was a shithole before Russia invaded: now it is a depopulated shithole buried under rubble.\nAnd the economic consequences for Russia have been baleful. Speaking of rubble, that describes the ruble now: it is now worth less than a penny. Official Russian statistics tout the strength of the Russian economy, but it is a war economy. Shoveling massive resources to the military, to be blown up in Ukraine, props up GDP, but people don’t consume aggregates. The economic circumstances of Russians have degraded substantially in the past 1000 days, and will only degrade more every additional day the war goes on. The Portuguese living standards that Putin once promised are a bad joke now.\nNeither side can achieve victory as they have defined it. Heretofore neither side has been willing to acknowledge that.\nTrump has boasted that he will end the war. Given the intransigence of the parties, this boast seems unrealistic. But perhaps he can exploit the fact that neither side gains from continuing the war to to cobble together something resembling peace.\nThe most likely path: another frozen conflict in which Putin will get de facto control of what he has grabbed in the past two plus years.\nThe biggest obstacle to this outcome is Zelensky. I think he is genuinely dead set (emphasis on the dead) on driving the Russians from Ukrainian territory. But that is a delusion.\nZelensky, apparently not realizing that he who pays the piper calls the tune, has demanded that the west supply the resources to achieve his objective. For one thing, such resources don’t exist, and meeting even a fraction of Zelensky’s demands would denude the US’s already scanty stocks of missiles and shells. The US has more pressing concerns than eastern Europe: eastern Asia in particular. Moreover, the real binding constraint on Zelensky’s ambitions is not hardware but meatware. Ukraine has too few soldiers, a large fraction of its military-age population is unwilling to serve, and it is even more of a demographic basket case than Russia.\nIn brief, Zelensky played a vital role at the outset of the war, and his conduct then was exemplary. But it has quite clearly gone to his head, and he is now a delusional autocrat who is an existential threat to the people he claims to represent. Not to mention a military incompetent (as discussed above).\nThe establishments in the United States and Europe inveigh against a settlement that leaves Putin in control of even a sliver of Ukraine. They invoke the ghost of Munich, and claim that Putin will use the respite to rearm and will then set his sights on Nato’s eastern flank.\nAs if. If this war has shown anything, it has shown that Russia’s ability to project conventional military power beyond its borders is virtually non-existent. Further, the army that went into Ukraine was supposedly the product of serious reforms that addressed the flaws exposed in Georgia in 2008. In the event, it wasn’t. Given the systemic defects of the Russian system (of which corruption in the military is just one symptom) any future “reforms” are almost certain to be as tragicomic as the previous ones.\nAnd how long would they take? Years. The establishments obsess on Putin, who is already 72. He will be well past his sell by date (especially by Russian male standards) by the time his allegedly reformed military will be capable of doing anything. And that is time that the Europeans can use to put on their big boy lederhosen and pantalons and create something other than Potemkin militaries that Putin (or more likely his successor) would be unwilling to confront.\nThat is, deterrence of Russia is completely in European hands. And if they decide to forego it, that’s their choice and their problem.\nSo Trump has a chance to realize his boast by negotiating (a la Teddy Roosevelt perhaps) an outcome that satisfies no one. But war is politics by other means, and politics is the art of the possible. The dreams of Putin, Zelensky, and the establishment are impossible. If Trump can get them to accept that, an imperfect peace is possible. And an imperfect peace is far preferable to the current nightmare.\nThe biggest challenge to achieving this is making it clear to Putin that he cannot prevail. Abandoning Ukraine altogether now would undermine that. So, rhetoric and I think genuine belief notwithstanding, to get his peace Trump will have to hold his nose and continue to fund Ukraine to some extent. The delicate balance to be found is between providing enough support to persuade Putin that continuing the war is futile, but not so much as to refill Zelensky’s pipe of dreams.\nThe acts of the dying Biden administration are certainly no help. The road to a settlement is torturous enough as it is without its malign actions.\nGive Trump a chance. The odds are against him, given the characters involved in the conflict. But the Biden administration seems hell bent on stacking the odds against him and denying him–and hence those dying in Ukraine–that chance.\nUkraine has shocked Russia–and to some extent the world–with a bold incursion into the Kursk Oblast of Russia proper. The Ukrainians have penetrated many kilometers into Russia, captured numerous prisoners, devastated several convoys of troops dispatched to stem the Ukrainian attack, and stirred up enough confusion to cause several Russian friendly fire episodes.\nThe Ukrainians adopted the Wee Willie Keeler strategy–hit ’em where they ain’t. This contrasts with the Russian strategy: hit ’em where they are; with your face; repeatedly. (Last year’s abortive Ukrainian counteroffensive was an example of them hitting ’em where they were. Apparently they’ve learned better).\nThe Ukrainian attack (of indeterminate strength, due to rather effective operational security) penetrated a stretch of the Russian border manned with neglected border troops (many of whom were underfed and who had not bathed for extended periods) and Chechen TikTok warriors. They advanced quickly, seized important roads, crossroads, and settlements. They have also sent out raiding parties to hit and run many kilometers in advance of the positions that they have secured and are preparing to hold.\nOf course this surprising and humiliating development has led to bitter recriminations and searches for scapegoats in Russia. The FSB claims that it warned Gerasimov and the Russian general staff of a Ukrainian buildup on the latter’s side of the border, but Gerasimov et al ignored their warnings.\nHistorically, almost every major military surprise was preceded by warnings and substantial intelligence that in retrospect foretold what occurred. It’s all in the interpretation of that information by the decision makers in advance that matters.\nSoon after the Russian offensive aimed at Kharkiv bogged down, the Ukrainians and the YouTube and Telegram channels that are often conduits for Ukrainian information operations warned that Russia was amassing forces in the Kursk region for a potential attack on the Sumy Oblast in Ukraine. It is uncertain whether such a buildup was actually taking place, but in many respects that is irrelevant. If Gerasimov et al took the Ukrainian warnings at face value they would have interpreted the Ukrainian concentration in Sumy as a preemptive defensive response rather than the harbinger of an invasion. Indeed, they would have considered this good news.\nIt would be particularly amusing if Russia had been running an influence operation threatening the opening of a new front in Sumy in order to draw Ukrainian troops to the area and away from where Russia really wanted to attack. In that case, Gerasimov would have rubbed his hands in glee at when the FSB delivered news of the Ukrainian move: “Our plan is working!!!”\nIt may be that Ukraine had initially moved troops north based on a belief of Russian action in Sumy, learned that it was at most a feint and that there were really no serious Russian forces in the area, and decided to flip the board and use the troops moved for defensive purposes for an offensive into a vacuum.\nIn other words, who psyched out whom here is not clear. It is quite possible that the Russians psyched themselves out in a too clever by half attempt to psych out the Ukrainians. Note that Gerasimov’s pre-war reputation for genius was based on his alleged mastery of such deception operations. (Remember the “Little Green Men”?)\nRegardless, Russia is clearly on the back foot here and scrambling to recover.\nThe Ukrainian operational objectives are unclear, are probably multifaceted, and likely will adjust depending on how the battle goes. One objective could be to disrupt Russian logistics further by interdicting a rail line that supplies the main Russian advances further south: Ukraine has been waging a steady drone and missile campaign against Russian logistics (including notably at air bases) and the Kursk incursion would fit into that broader campaign. Another natural one would be to cause a diversion of Russian forces from Donetsk and Luhansk. Delivering a political embarrassment to Putin would be another worthy goal.\nHow much further will Ukraine go? I doubt very far. Expanding the breakthrough would require many more forces and create severe logistical strains for the Ukrainians themselves. How long will they stay? That depends on the Russian response and how Ukraine deals with it.\nIt seems that initially that the Russian reaction is helter skelter, sending random collections of units (sometimes stray platoons) forward piecemeal. This has exposed them to being defeated in details by fires (drones and artillery), often while strung out on the road. If the Russians continue to do this, the Ukrainians can stay a rather long time: if they come on the same old style, the Ukrainians will meet them in the same old style.\nThe smarter thing for the Russians to do would be to amass forces carefully and systematically relatively far back from the Ukrainian front line, and then attack simultaneously on multiple axes. But the Russians haven’t shown the ability to do anything smart so far. Nor have they demonstrated the ability to engage in operational maneuvers with multiple units over a broad front: their recent offensive batterings in Donetsk and Luhansk have been almost exclusively piecemeal attacks of platoon sized units on the same, single axis, day after day. Moreover, the humiliation of this incursion and Putin’s frustration strongly push the Russians to a frantic, extemporized response. And if the Russians do the smart, it will take some considerable time, which the Ukrainians can draw out with continued attacks on logistics.\nSo either way, I expect Ukraine to be camping out in Kursk well into the autumn.\nOne other amusing aspect of this episode is the Russian hysterical demands that the international community condemn this violation of sacred Russian territorial sovereignty. “MOM! NO FAIR! UKRAINE HIT ME BACK!”\nCry me a river, Vova. Have have fun in the Second Battle of Kursk. I don’t think it will turn out as well for you as the first one did for Stalin.\nAs I noted in a previous post, the Biden administration has tried to restrain Ukraine from attacking Russian oil refineries. The previous reason, as set forth by SecDef Lloyd “AWOL” Austin, was that these attacks would disrupt world energy markets.\nTranslation: these attacks would increase gasoline prices which scares the bejesus out of an inflation-battered administration in an election year.\nBut apparently the administration decided that wasn’t a very good look. Too obviously self-serving, and perhaps too dissonant with its the-war-in-Ukraine-is-a-vital-US-national-interest one.\nSo, would you believe, the administration is REALLY concerned on humanitarian, just war grounds:\nNah, we wouldn’t believe that, actually. Especially since this oh-so high minded critique of Ukrainian military tactics has heretofore been completely absent from American policy makers’ discourses. It’s obviously a lie to cover the election-obsessed administration’s true motivations. That is, AWOL Austin committed the Kinseyan gaffe of speaking the truth, and this gaffe had to be cleaned up.\nThis justification is also utterly ridiculous on myriad grounds. For one thing, as Rep. Scott pointed out, why should Ukraine fight asymmetrically, but in a bad way, taking blow after blow to its civilian targets but not striking back. For another, oil refineries are a legitimate military target, given (a) Russia’s armies in Ukraine run on the fuel they produce, (b) fuel exports are a material source of revenue for the Russian government, and (c) the Kremlin is clearly concerned about higher fuel prices, and the potential effect they would have on support for the war.\nFor yet another, in military conflicts in the modern age the United States has made attacking enemy energy assets a primary target. In WWII, the most effective element of the strategic bombing offensive (and one that probably should have been introduced earlier) was the attacks on Germany synthetic fuel production. (The attacks on the oil fields at Ploesti, Romania in 1943 less successful, but the April-August 1944 attacks did materially restrict fuel supplies to the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe). In Gulf War I, one of the first targets of American air strikes (after Iraqi air defenses were dismantled in the first wave) were Iraqi electric power plants, which were attacked with graphite bombs. Soon after, the US turned its attention to, yes, Iraqi oil refineries. In 1999 the US unleashed graphite bombs on Serbian power plants.\nThe US, in other words, has long recognized the strategic importance of enemy energy production, and has made it a priority target. So why shouldn’t Ukraine?\nAnd note that given the previous history, Wallender is implicitly accusing the United States of violating the laws of armed conflict.\nIt’s actually quite disgusting that the administration covers its nakedly political motivations with high sounding blather about “the laws of armed conflict” and the “standards of European democracy.” Maxwell Smart was funny. These clowns are not.\nYesterday was Groundhog Day, and the classic movie by that name is an apt metaphor for the war in Ukraine. Different day, same bad shit, day after day after day.\nDefense Minister and all around shlub Sergei Shoigu proudly claims that Russia has the initiative. Yeah, I guess you could say that, because they are the ones attacking repeatedly all along the front. But seizing the initiative yields them nothing but piles of corpses (disproportionately Russian) and masses of demolished tanks and AFVs (almost all Russian). It certainly does not yield them gains on the ground, at least not gains measured in more than meters, and a tree line or field here or there.\nRussian tactics, such as they are, beggar description. Day after day they send penny packets of armored vehicles in strung out along some muddy track, only to see them centimated (decimated means losing one out of ten, so I made up a more accurate word). The armor seldom makes contact before it is blown up. What progress the Russians do make is with bloody infantry assaults that take slivers of ground, often because the Ukrainians run out of ammunition. Sometimes those slivers are taken away in counterattacks.\nDecisive action by armor requires it to be deployed in mass. Sending a platoon here and a platoon there is idiotic and cannot achieve anything, let alone a decisive breakthrough.\nTo give an idea of how farcical this all is, in a rare Russian advance measuring more than a kilometer (in southern Avdiivka) they tunneled under a Ukrainian strongpoint, popped out of the ground, and seized it. As a result, Russia obtained a long finger of territory, under fire control and at constant threat of attack on either or both sides of the bulge.\nWhat, is Russia going to tunnel its way to Kiev, let alone Lviv or Odessa?\nMost of the Russian vehicle casualties are now caused by drones, especially First Person Video (FPV) drones (you don’t hear much about Bayraktars anymore), rather than artillery. That’s because the Ukrainians are suffering from a severe shell shortage. Western stocks and production cannot keep pace with the prodigious consumption of ammunition in a static battle.\nVideos tell the tale. Back in the summer many videos (taken from drones) depicted Russians being plastered with artillery, and cluster munitions in particular. One seldom sees those now. Instead, it is video after video of FPVs smashing into Russian armor: some from the attacking FPVs themselves, some from recon drones loitering overhead.\nUkraine’s vaunted summer offensive, which was worse than a damp squib, was stymied primarily as a result of deep Russian prepared defense lines, including dense mine belts. Apparently after eschewing constructing such defenses themselves, Ukraine is belatedly doing so. (The fraught situation around Avdiivka largely reflects the lack of prepared defenses in that salient.)\nUkraine apparently took a similar attitude to the French and British in WWI, whereas the Russians adopted the German approach. The Germans built massive, semi-permanent fortifications in the lands they captured in France and Belgium: one of the few interesting parts of the otherwise vastly overrated film 1917 was the depiction of the elaborate German trenches and bunkers that they abandoned when withdrawing to the Hindenberg Line, and which amazed the Tommys who stumbled into them. The Tommys were amazed because their trenches (and French ones too) were much less elaborate, and much more in the nature of temporary field fortifications than permanent positions (like the Germans’). This was a conscious choice by the Allies, and in particular the French, who reasoned (if you can use that word here) that building more permanent defenses would be seen as a concession to German occupation of French lands, demarcating a new border. The trenches were just launching points for offensives–that failed.\nUkraine’s failure to build up lines analogous to the Russian Sorovikin Lines (three deep) is evidently due to the same “reasoning.” Building them would establish a de facto border.\nThe reconsideration of more elaborate defensive lines is just one reflection of a command crisis in Ukraine. The failed offensive and the recognition that the war is likely to drag on for years is creating consternation in Kiev, and one manifestation of this is the falling out between Zelensky and Ukrainian military chief Valery Zaluzhny. Zelensky is trying to push Zaluzhny out, but the general says: I won’t quit, you have to fire me. Given Zaluzhny’s popularity, that’s risky for Zelensky to do–although truth be told Zaluzhny’s popularity is probably the main reason Zelensky wants him gone.\nZaluzhny’s fate was sealed last year in articles quoting him criticizing Zelensky and the Ukrainian strategy overall. Doubling down, yesterday he released an article calling for a complete revision of Ukrainian strategy.\nSo all is not happy in Kiev, but it shouldn’t be smiles and giggles in Moscow either because if anything Putin’s strategy and tactics are failing even worse than Ukraine’s. But Vlad appears drunk on delusions, this week saying that his objective was to advance the front sufficiently to put Russian-occupied territory out of range of Western-supplied long range weaponry. Beyond the fact that this logic implies that Russia would have to occupy all of western Europe (including the UK!) because more territory would be required to create a buffer for the new territory (wash, rinse, repeat), this reflects a complete failure to recognize the realities on the ground, where Russians cannot take and hold meters here and there, let alone tens or hundreds of kilometers along a 1000 kilometer front.\nThe one area in which Ukraine has achieved some success is in deep strikes by drones and Western weapons (e.g., Scalp missiles, HIMARs). And by deep, I mean well inside Russia, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities. These strikes have hit air bases and economic targets, most notably arms manufacturing facilities, ports, and oil assets.\nCrimea has been hit the hardest. The Black Sea Fleet has been driven away to Novorossiysk after losing several ships in Sevastopol. Russian air bases and command centers on the peninsula have also been hammered.\nFascinatingly, high ranking Russians, including the commander of the Black Sea Fleet and even the head of the Stavka, Valery Gerasimov, have not bee seen since attacks on Sevastopol, leading to suspicions that they were killed or badly wounded in the strikes. Hell, Lloyd Austin reappeared after a couple of weeks. Gerasimov has been MIA for 35 days. Where’s Valery?\nThe success of these strikes lays bare the Potemkin nature of Russian air defenses, including their vaunted S-400 systems. Indeed, the Ukrainians have taken out many of these systems: SAMs, defend thyself!\nThe Russians claim to shoot down everything shot at them. I mean everything. So why the explosions and destruction of valuable assets? Well, you see, the missiles and drones their valiant air defenses down hit the targets while plummeting to earth. Like this one that started massive fires at a Lukoil facility:\nDizzy with success! Or should it be on fire with success?\nThe failure of Russian air defenses should not be surprise. Soviet and Russian built AA systems have been shredded every time they have been confronted since their initial successes (due largely to surprise) in North Vietnam in the late-60s and early-70s, and Egypt (in 1973). After the shock of their losses to these systems in those wars, the Americans and Israelis designed and implemented comprehensive suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD–which really means DEAD, for destruction of enemy air defenses) operations. Dismantling of Russian air defenses is therefore not unexpected, although it is shocking to see how Ukraine has been able to extemporize a successful SEAD strategy with such scant resources, especially as compared to the US and Israel.\nThe chain reaction effects have been fascinating to watch. Ukrainian destruction of Russian ground based radars required them to fly their version of AWACs (the A-50) close to the shores of the Sea of Azov–which happened to be in range of Ukrainian operated Patriots, which destroyed the A-50 and seriously damaged its companion aircraft, an IL-22 (poor man’s version of an RC-135 Rivet Joint).\nThese deep strikes are damaging, and embarrassing to Russia. (Assuming Putin is capable of embarrassment, which on the basis of the record is a dubious proposition.) But they are not war winning.\nInstead, they are just another vignette in Groundhog War.\nI haven’t written much about this war because there’s seldom little new to say. I have every expectation that there will be another long hiatus, because there’s nothing in prospect that will decisively alter the situation.\nThe war in Ukraine grinds on with no appreciable movement on either side–except in the body counts.\nThe conflict is often compared to World War I, but this is in some respects unfair to World War I. Territorial gains on both sides are measured in meters–when there is any progress at all. Even catastrophic assaults like the Second and Third Battles of Artois in 1915 saw the French advance a few miles.\nThe most extreme current example is the sustained Russian assault on Avdiivka. Day after day for more than a month the Russians have mounted attacks on the three fronts of the Ukrainian salient enclosing the town. And day after day their attacks are repelled with massive losses. Many times the assaulting troops do not even make it to the contact line, being smashed by Ukrainian artillery and drones as they move to contact.\nAt most the Russians take a field or two here, a tree line there.\nThe Ukrainian experience to the south, around Verbotene, is much the same. The Ukrainians made some decent (albeit slow) progress there during the summer, creating a modest bulge in the Russian positions, and here and there breaching Russian minefields and fortifications. But for months the two sides have fought to a standstill, exchanging fields and tree lines here and there.\nMoreover, in each location the attackers at first attempted armored assaults, only to suffer massive tank losses from mines, artillery, and drones. Consequently, each now mounts small infantry assaults. In Avdiivka, the Russian AFVs drop off their mounted infantry a couple of kilometers from the front. The soldiers slog forward and then throw themselves into frontal assaults.\nYou can find lots of video of the results on Telegram. It is not pleasant viewing.\nAnd if these infantry assaults succeed breaching enemy lines? Nothing will change. Just as in WWI, infantry cannot exploit a penetration by infantry. The “successful” attackers are worn out and often combat ineffective due to heavy losses. Even if they were capable of moving forward, or reserves could be rushed into the breach (something neither side has proved able to do) the defenders can withdraw and regroup faster than the attackers can advance. Meaning that a “breakthrough” just moves the stalemate a kilometer or two. Absent the ability to exploit with armor–and crucially, without the logistics to support armored exploitation–decisive advances are impossible.\nThe stasis of the battlefield is in large part due to the inability of either side to achieve air superiority. In Ukraine, air superiority does not refer to manned fixed wing aircraft or helicopters, but drones. Both sides are able to operate drones for both reconnaissance and attack with relative impunity. This is a major reason (mines being another) for the impotence of armored forces.\nThe only front holding out the prospect for maneuver is in the south, on the left bank of the Dnieper/Dnipro River near Kherson. Unlike on the remainder of the front, here Russia did not create deep lines of entrenchments, and its forces are spread relatively thin. But an advance here would require Ukraine to send large amounts of supplies over a wide river, and it is doubtful that it is capable of doing this. (Its logistic capabilities to support a deep drive are suspect generally, even without the necessity of bridging a wide river, and defending the bridges.)\nThe Ukrainian government and its Western supporters claim that if it only had more weapons, it could drive out the Russians. Given the trivial incremental effect of the offensive weapons already supplied, this is to be seriously doubted.\nThe real constraint on Ukraine now is manpower, not equipment. It started at a severe manpower disadvantage, exacerbated by the emigration of many military aged men, evasion of conscription, and lukewarm volunteering. In contrast, Russia has proved able to replace its ravaged ranks by hook and crook, even without resorting to a formal nationwide mobilization. Even at an inflated exchange ratio, this meat swap is a contest that Ukraine cannot win.\nThat said, there is no real prospect for peace because Zelensky and many others in Ukraine are still wedded to the idea of driving Russia out of Ukraine altogether, and Putin is perfectly willing to pay the exchange rate for as long as it takes to out wait Ukraine.\nIsrael stupidly hit pause in the other war, in Gaza, apparently bowing to U.S. pressure. The pressure was stupid, and bowing to it was too. Israel was making steady progress at extirpating Hamas and digging up–literally–its military infrastructure.\nThe deal it made with Hamas takes off the pressure on the terrorist organization. Moreover, the terms of the deal, in which Israel releases more prisoners than Hamas does hostages only encourages future hostage taking. This is utterly insane.\nThe fecklessness of Biden and his administration exceeds even what I had expected–which is saying something. The only American hostage released so far is . . . wait for it . . . a relative of one of the connoisseurs of Hunter’s art. I mean you cannot make this shit up. And it demonstrates that the administration calculates that it will pay no political price.\nThe proper response to the taking of American hostages should have been reboot of “Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.” The Hamas “leadership” livin’ large in Qatar (apparently on large stacks totaling billions) should have been told: all our hostages alive, or you dead.\nBut noooooo. Indeed, that’s not even the worst example of his cravenness. Yesterday, he abjectly apologized to five (unnamed) Muslim heavyweights for questioning whether Gazan “authorities'” (AKA Hamas stooges’) casualty figures are accurate.\nJoe is disappointed in himself. Aren’t we all. Aren’t we all.\nHe “promises to do better.” Even though the bar is very low indeed, I’m taking the under on that one. It’s always the sure bet with Biden.\nWar is always grim. These wars are even grimmer than most. They will be long running attractions, with no constructive results.\nElon Musk is taking a lot of heat from the Ukraine Amen Corner over his decision not to extend Starlink internet service to cover Crimea–Sevastopol in particular–because of fears that Ukraine would launch an attack on the Russian fleet based there, and this would spur a massive retaliation by Russia. Musk has claimed in particular that he feared the possibility of a nuclear retaliation.\nThere are conflicting stories. The one is that SpaceX turned off Starlink coverage to Crimea precisely when Ukrainian submersible drones were inbound. Denied navigational assistance and control provided by the satellites, the drones went stupid and the attack failed. The other–which Musk laid out himself on X–is that Starlink did not cover Crimea, the Ukrainians asked him to activate its coverage there, and he declined.\nThe second story is more plausible than the first. How would Musk know that an attack was on its way? And there has been no evidence of any such attack: in more recent drone strikes, the Russians have provided images of beached drones and video of drones being sunk by Russian gunfire.\nFor one thing, this assumes that the drone strike would have inflicted devastating damage on the fleet. Subsequent strikes (guided how?) have inflicted some damage, but have hardly posed a major threat to the striking power of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.\nFor another, since when is an American company obligated to make its resources available to a foreign country to commit an act of war against a nation with which the US is not at war, and which has the world’s largest force of nukes to boot? Indeed, do we want CEOs making those kind of choices, given that especially when dealing with someone like Putin the target would immediately attribute responsibility to the United States? Such would be a major national security policy decision and should be made by those Constitutionally responsible–although given the current government, they may not be constitutionally fitted. But even given the dubious judgment of the current administration, it is they who should be making such decisions, not corporate CEOs.\nIf anything, it should go the other way. Companies should be prohibited from making such clearly belligerent moves on their own hook.\nThe FMS sales process begins when a country submits a formal Letter of Request (LOR). Ideally, this includes both a desired military capability, and a rough estimate of what the partner is able to spend. Sales are approved following U.S. government review and, when required, after Congressional notification. After the sale is approved, the DSCA issues a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) specifying the defense articles, training, and support being offered for delivery. Major FMS sales formally notified to Congress are publicly announced on the DSCA website\nProviding an asset complementary to things that blow up–and which are indeed necessary for the use of the things that blow up even if they don’t blow up themselves, as Starlink supposedly was in this instance–should be subject to the same strict scrutiny and approval.\nAnd again ironies and idiocies abound here. Those who consistently condemn Putin as evil and perhaps irrational dismiss Musk’s concerns about nuclear retaliation. Those who routinely attack Musk’s actions–and his management of Twitter in particular–want to delegate war making decisions to him.\nElon making decisions about waging war on Putin. Yeah, nothing unpredictable or frightening about that, right?\nIt should also be noted that the United States has been extremely circumspect about supplying weapons that Ukraine could use to strike at Russian territory, and at Crimea. The hemming-and-hawing about F-16s is one example, as is the continued reluctance to supply long-range ATACMS missiles. Even approval of main battle tanks–which pose little threat to Russian territory proper–occurred only after much debate and indecision. And for years–even following Russia’s invasion of Donetsk in 2014–the US was incredibly stingy about providing even clearly defensive weapons (like ATGMs) to Ukraine.\nMeaning that those who attack Musk for not facilitating Ukrainian offensive capability into Russian- and Russian-claimed territory should really direct their fire at the administration. It’s their call, not Musk’s, and they have been just as cautious–if not more–than Elon.\nThe utter ingratitude of Ukraine to Musk is truly astounding. He kept Starlink operational over Ukraine for months on his own tab, and it was vital to its military operations. Yet since he doesn’t cater to their every whim–even potentially very ill-considered ones that implicate the United States–they demonize him incessantly. I believe that if Musk was not so dependent on the US government generally, and the security state in particular (especially insofar as SpaceX is concerned) he would tell them to GFY.\nI have been very critical of Musk on some things, more favorably disposed on others. Here is a case where he is clearly in the right.",

The attack struck Kyiv and the southern port city of Odesa. In an online statement, Zelenskyy said that Moscow’s forces fired over 315 drones, most of them Shaheds, and seven missiles overnight. “Russian missile and Shahed strikes are louder than the efforts of the United States and others around the world to force Russia into peace,” Zelenskyy wrote, urging “concrete action” from the U.S. and Europe in response to the attack. READ MORE: Zelenskyy asks Western allies to boost air defense deliveries as Hegseth skips Ukraine meeting A maternity hospital and residential buildings in the southern port of Odesa were damaged in the attack, regional head Oleh Kiper said. Two people were killed and nine injured, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Another person was killed in Kyiv’s Obolon district, regional head Tymur Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. “Russian strikes are once again hitting not military targets but the lives of ordinary people. This once again shows the true nature of what we are dealing with,” he said. Explosions and the buzzing of drones were heard around the city for hours. Attacks continue despite talks but POWs swapped The fresh attacks came a day after Moscow launched almost 500 drones at Ukraine in the biggest overnight drone bombardment in the war. Ukrainian and Western officials have been anticipating a Russian response to Kyiv’s audacious June 1 drone attack on distant Russian air bases. Russia has been launching a record-breaking number of drones and missiles in recent days, despite both sides trading memoranda during direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 that set out conditions for a potential ceasefire. However, the inclusion of clauses that both sides see as nonstarters make any quick deal unlikely, and a ceasefire, long sought by Kyiv, remains elusive. The only tangible outcome of the talks has been in the exchange of prisoners of war, with a swap that began Monday for soldiers aged between 18 and 25. WATCH: Trump visits Fort Bragg military base for speech to troops and families Amina Ivanchenko was reunited Monday with her husband, a POW for 18 months, and she thanked Ukrainian officials for supporting her. “My struggle was much easier thanks to them. Our country will definitely return everyone. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you!” Anastasia Nahorna waited in the Chernyhiv region to see if her husband, who has been missing for eight months, was among those being released in the latest swap. “This pain is more unbearable every day,” she said. “I really want to hear some news, because since the moment of his disappearance, unfortunately, there has been no information. Is he alive? or maybe in captivity? Has someone seen him?” she asked. Anna Rodionova, the wife of another Ukrainian POW, also was waiting. “I just want him to come back soon and for this to all be over,” she said. “We are tired of waiting, we come every exchange and he is not there.” A similar exchange also was announced for the bodies of fallen soldiers held by both sides, although no schedule has been released. Asked to comment on the exchange of bodies with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was unclear when it could take place and how many bodies Ukraine would hand over. He again accused Kyiv of dragging its feet on the exchange. “There is one unarguable fact, we have had trucks with bodies standing ready for it on the border for several days,” he told reporters. Kyiv residents seek shelter Plumes of smoke rose in Kyiv as air defense forces worked to shoot down drones and missiles Tuesday. Viktoriia Melnyk, 30, vented her anger at the Russians after her building in the Obolonskyi district was struck by a drone. “I want them to leave our territory, to leave us alone, to leave our families alone,” she said. “Small children are dying. This is not normal. It’s not normal that (the world) is turning away. This is not normal for the 21st century.” Other residents took shelter and slept in metro stations during the long attack. Nina Nosivets, 32, and her 8-month-old son, Levko, were among them. “I just try not to think about all this, silently curled up like a mouse, wait until it all passes, the attacks. Distract the child somehow because it’s probably the hardest thing for him to bear,” she said. Krystyna Semak, 37, said the explosions frightened her and she ran to the metro at 2 a.m., carrying a rug. Fires broke out in at least four Kyiv districts after debris from downed drones fell onto residential buildings and warehouses, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. “I was lying in bed, as always hoping that these Shaheds would fly past me, and I heard that Shahed (that hit the house),” said Vasyl Pesenko, 25, standing in his damaged kitchen. “I thought that it would fly away, but it flew closer and closer and everything blew away.” The attack sparked 19 fires across Ukraine, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram. “Russia must answer for every crime it commits. Until there is justice, there will be no security. For Ukraine. And for the world,” he said. Death toll from recent attacks rises The Russian Defense Ministry said an attack early Tuesday targeted arms plants in Kyiv, as well as military headquarters, troops locations, air bases and arms depots across Ukraine. “The goals of the strikes have been achieved, all the designated targets have been hit,” it said in a statement. The death toll from previous Russian strikes also rose Tuesday. In Kharkiv, rescuers found a body under the rubble of a building that was hit in an attack Saturday, Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on Telegram. The discovery brought the number of casualties there to five, with five others potentially under the debris, Terekhov said. Meanwhile, in the northern city of Sumy, a 17-year-old boy died of his injuries Tuesday after a June 3 attack, acting Mayor Artem Kobzar wrote on Telegram. It brought the number killed in the attack to six. Airports close amid strikes on Russia The Russian Defense Ministry reported downing 102 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions and Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The drones were downed both over regions on the border with Ukraine and deeper inside Russia, including central Moscow and Leningrad regions, according to the Defense Ministry. Because of the drone attack, flights were temporarily restricted at multiple Russian airports, including all four in Moscow and the Pulkovo airport in St. Petersburg, the country’s second-largest city.

Asked to comment on the exchange of bodies with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was unclear when it could take place and how many bodies Ukraine would hand over. He again accused Kyiv of dragging its feet on the exchange. “There is one unarguable fact, we have had trucks with bodies standing ready for it on the border for several days,” he told reporters. Kyiv residents seek shelter Plumes of smoke rose in Kyiv as air defense forces worked to shoot down drones and missiles Tuesday. Viktoriia Melnyk, 30, vented her anger at the Russians after her building in the Obolonskyi district was struck by a drone. “I want them to leave our territory, to leave us alone, to leave our families alone,” she said. “Small children are dying. This is not normal. It’s not normal that (the world) is turning away. This is not normal for the 21st century.” Other residents took shelter and slept in metro stations during the long attack. Nina Nosivets, 32, and her 8-month-old son, Levko, were among them. “I just try not to think about all this, silently curled up like a mouse, wait until it all passes, the attacks. Distract the child somehow because it’s probably the hardest thing for him to bear,” she said. Krystyna Semak, 37, said the explosions frightened her and she ran to the metro at 2 a.m., carrying a rug. Fires broke out in at least four Kyiv districts after debris from downed drones fell onto residential buildings and warehouses, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. “I was lying in bed, as always hoping that these Shaheds would fly past me, and I heard that Shahed (that hit the house),” said Vasyl Pesenko, 25, standing in his damaged kitchen. “I thought that it would fly away, but it flew closer and closer and everything blew away.” The attack sparked 19 fires across Ukraine, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on Telegram. “Russia must answer for every crime it commits. Until there is justice, there will be no security. For Ukraine. And for the world,” he said. Death toll from recent attacks rises The Russian Defense Ministry said an attack early Tuesday targeted arms plants in Kyiv, as well as military headquarters, troops locations, air bases and arms depots across Ukraine. “The goals of the strikes have been achieved, all the designated targets have been hit,” it said in a statement. The death toll from previous Russian strikes also rose Tuesday. In Kharkiv, rescuers found a body under the rubble of a building that was hit in an attack Saturday, Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on Telegram. The discovery brought the number of casualties there to five, with five others potentially under the debris, Terekhov said. Meanwhile, in the northern city of Sumy, a 17-year-old boy died of his injuries Tuesday after a June 3 attack, acting Mayor Artem Kobzar wrote on Telegram. It brought the number killed in the attack to six. Airports close amid strikes on Russia The Russian Defense Ministry reported downing 102 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions and Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The drones were downed both over regions on the border with Ukraine and deeper inside Russia, including central Moscow and Leningrad regions, according to the Defense Ministry. Because of the drone attack, flights were temporarily restricted at multiple Russian airports, including all four in Moscow and the Pulkovo airport in St. Petersburg, the country’s second-largest city.

            "Russia claims gains in Ukraine as US attention focuses on Iran war. Russia on Monday evening claimed to have captured the entirety of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, marking the first time since its illegal invasion began three years ago that it may fully occupy an entire region.\nFox News Digital could not independently verify the claim made by Leonid Pasechnik, the Moscow-appointed leader of Luhansk, which Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed in 2022 along with the regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\nKyiv has not yet commented on Pasechnik’s claims issued Monday evening when speaking with Russian state TV outlet Channel One, in which he said \"literally two days ago\" he had received a report that \"100%\" of the region was now fully occupied, first reported the Associated Press.\nUKRAINE MOVES TOWARD WITHDRAWING FROM TREATY BANNING ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES\nRussia is still assessed to occupy less than 20% of Ukraine, which includes Luhansk as well as some 70% of the other three regions it has claimed to have annexed, according to Reuters – though it is unclear if this figure also includes Russia's occupation of Crimea.\nReports on Monday showed that Russia had amassed some 50,000 troops on Ukraine's northern border near the Sumy region, sparking concerns that Putin could be planning another major offensive.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces had been moved to the region a week ago in preparation of any Russian offensive.\n\"The Russian plan for an offensive in Sumy is not being realized, and that is thanks to every Ukrainian unit operating in the area,\" he said in a social media post on Telegram.\nWhen asked about Russia's plans on Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We will see what happens, I'm watching it very closely.\"\nMoscow over the last two months has drastically intensified its war efforts in Ukraine despite attempts by Trump to push a ceasefire and an end to the war.\nWhile Ukraine has agreed to Washington’s ceasefire proposals, Putin has flatly rejected all attempts and broken deadlines set forth by Trump.\nIn June, Russia launched more than 5,300 Shahed-type drones in a series of mass attacks that have become more frequent and more deadly, reported the Kyiv Independent, citing the Ukrainian Air Force.\nThe 5,337 kamikaze drones fired at Ukraine last month alone reportedly shattered Moscow’s previous record of 4,198 drones fired in March – a record that coincided with the renewed outbreak of war against Iran as first Israel, and then the U.S., targeted Tehran’s nuclear infrastructure in June.\nWhile European nations have remained steadfast in their support of Ukraine, Washington’s support since Trump re-took office in January has wavered from the Biden administration as the U.S. has turned its attention to Israel's war in Gaza, returning the hostages and addressing Iran’s nuclear threat.\nRUSSIA LAUNCHED ITS LARGEST AERIAL ATTACK OF THE WAR, UKRAINE SAYS\nU.S.-led attempts to broker a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire appear to have stalled, and little communication has been reported between Washington and Moscow following Trump’s previous call with Putin in mid-June.\nTrump maintains that Putin is looking for a way to end the war, and told reporters during a NATO news conference last week, \"I know one thing – he'd like to settle.\"\n\"He'd like to get out of this thing.

The claim by the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, which came on a holiday celebrating Russia’s sovereignty, is in line with Western intelligence estimates. President Vladimir Putin marked Russia Day by hosting a Kremlin meeting with soldiers decorated for their service in Ukraine, but neither he nor any other officials commented on the Ukrainian claim. The U.K. Defense Ministry also said in a statement posted Thursday on X that Russia has suffered over 1 million casualties, including roughly 250,000 killed since it launched the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. On June 3, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Russia likely would hit the mark of 1 million casualties this summer in what it called “a stunning and grisly milestone.” Russia last reported its military casualties early in the war when it acknowledged that about 6,000 soldiers had been killed. Earlier this year, the General Staff of the Russian armed forces claimed that Ukrainian military losses had topped 1 million. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last spoke of Ukrainian military losses in February, when he said in an interview that 45,100 troops had been killed and about 390,000 injured. The mutual claims of the other side’s losses couldn’t be independently verified. Russia launches more drone strikes The casualty estimates came as Russian forces pummeled Ukraine with drones and other weapons, killing three people and injuring scores of others despite international pressure to accept a ceasefire. According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched 63 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. It said that air defenses destroyed 28 drones while another 21 were jammed. Ukrainian police said two people were killed and six were injured in the past 24 hours in the eastern Donetsk region, the focus of the Russian offensive. One person was killed and 14 others were also injured in the southern Kherson region, which is partly occupied by Russian forces, police said. The authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said 18 people, including four children, were injured by Russian drone attacks overnight. WATCH: How Ukraine’s drones have transformed the fight against Russia Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian drones targeted residential districts, educational facilities, kindergartens and other civilian infrastructure. “Kharkiv is holding on. People are alive. And that is the most important thing,” Terekhov said. Russia has launched waves of drones and missiles in recent days, with a record bombardment of almost 500 drones on Monday and a wave of 315 drones and seven missiles overnight on Tuesday. Ukraine responded to the Russian attacks with drone raids. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 52 Ukrainian drones early Thursday, including 41 over the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said a 2-year-old boy was killed Thursday in a Ukrainian drone attack, which also injured his grandmother. He previously reported three other injuries. Russia pushes its slow offensive in Ukraine’s east The recent escalation in aerial attacks has come alongside a renewed Russian battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line. While Russian missile and drone barrage have struck regions all across Ukraine, regions along the front line have faced daily Russian attacks with short-range exploding drones and glide bombs. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed its troops captured two more villages in the Donetsk region, Oleksiivka and Petrivske. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim. The attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. During their June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely. Russia and Ukraine exchange more POWs The only tangible outcome of the talks was an agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers. Russia and Ukraine conducted another POW swap on Thursday that included severely wounded and gravely ill captives, although the sides did not report the numbers. “Our people are coming home,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. “All of them require medical treatment, and they will receive the necessary help. This is already the second stage of returning those who are severely wounded and seriously ill.” WATCH: In Merz meeting, Trump says it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia ‘fight for a while’ According to Ukraine’s Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, some of the repatriated soldiers had been listed as missing in action. The oldest among them is 59, the youngest is 22, he said. Oksana Nepotribna, mother of one of the released Ukrainian soldiers, said he was in captivity for a year. “We were really waiting for him, we thank everyone who freed him,” she said. NATO chief hails Trump’s peace efforts In Rome, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte commended U.S. President Donald Trump for his “crucial” move to start direct peace talks. At the same time, Rutte criticized Putin for appointing his aide Vladimir Medinsky as the top negotiator for the talks in Istanbul. Medinsky ascended through the Kremlin ranks after writing a series of books exposing purported Western plots against Russia and denigrating Ukraine. “I think that the Russians sending this historian now twice to these talks in Istanbul, trying to start with the history of 1,000 years ago and then explaining more or less that Ukraine is at fault here, I think that’s not helpful,” Rutte said. “But at least step by step, we try to make progress.” Also on Thursday, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit, noting the stepped-up Russian attacks send a message from Moscow that it has “no interest in a peaceful solution at present,” according to German news agency dpa. Pistorius underscored Germany’s intention to help Ukraine build its own long-range missile systems and help it finance purchases of homemade material. “The first systems should be available in the coming months,” he said, adding that Germany will allocate about 9 billion euros ($10.3 billion) for supporting Ukraine this year. “We are deeply convinced that it is the job of the Europeans … to keep supporting Ukraine, and we want to lead the way and demonstrate corresponding responsibility,” he added.

They're warning signs that your information is being circulated through data brokers, often without your knowledge or consent.\nMajor breaches, like the recent Adidas hack, have exposed millions of names, emails, phone numbers, and home addresses. Once this data is leaked, it's fed into a vast marketplace of data brokers who package, sell, and resell your information to advertisers, spammers, scammers and even cybercriminals.\nThink it hasn't happened to you? Here are 10 red flags that your data is already out there and the steps you can take to stop it from spreading further.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide free when you join.\nBe proactive about your privacy\nIf your personal information appears on people-finder sites or in sketchy online databases, it stays there until you remove it. This means your full name, home address, email, and phone number are available to anyone, including scammers and stalkers. You can manually opt out of each site, but that takes time and patience. Instead, consider an automated privacy service that scans data broker sites and sends removal requests on your behalf. The less data floating around, the less likely it is to be misused.\n11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025\nOVER 8M PATIENT RECORDS LEAKED IN HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH\n10 signs your data is being bought and sold\nIf any of these are happening to you, your data is likely already floating around the broker and scammer economy. Here's what to watch for:\n1. You're suddenly flooded with spam emails\nIf your inbox is overflowing with shady product offers, sketchy promotions, or strange marketing emails you never signed up for, it's a good bet your email address has been sold. This kind of spam typically results from your address being added to mass marketing lists purchased in bulk.\n2. You're getting nonstop scam calls\nMore calls than usual from unknown numbers? Telemarketers, fake IRS agents, and car warranty scammers often use brokered phone lists. If you're getting several calls a day, it likely means your number is being recycled by different call centers and fraud operations.\n3. You receive password-reset emails you didn't request\nUnfamiliar password-reset prompts are a sign someone is attempting to access your account. They may have found your email address and other leaked credentials and are now probing for weak points. It's a key signal that your digital footprint is being exploited.\n4. You notice strange charges on your bank account\nTiny charges can be a test by cybercriminals to see if stolen card info works. If even one unrecognized charge shows up, it's critical to act fast. These small transactions often lead to bigger, more damaging fraud if ignored.\n5. You're locked out of your own accounts\nLosing access to your email, bank, or social media accounts may mean hackers have already reset your passwords. With enough personal data, criminals can bypass security questions and fully take over your identity online.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n6. Friends say they got weird messages from you\nIf your contacts report strange DMs, fake money requests, or odd links coming from your accounts, that's a strong sign someone else has gained access. Cybercriminals use this tactic to trick your friends into clicking dangerous links or handing over money.\n7. Sketchy social media accounts start following you\nA wave of fake profiles suddenly following or messaging you is more than annoying; it could be a coordinated attempt to gather more information about you or impersonate you later. These accounts may also be bots programmed to phish for details or direct you to scam pages.\n8. Personal info is already filled in on new websites\nIf your name, email, or phone number shows up on a form before you even touch the keyboard, that website may have purchased your information. Some sites share consumer data with partners, and this pre-fill behavior can indicate that your data is being sold and shared.\n9. You find your profile on people-search websites\nSites like Spokeo or Whitepages can display your full name, home address, phone number, family members, and more often scraped from public records or sold by data brokers. This makes you a target for identity theft, scams, and unwanted contact.\n10. You're denied credit or insurance for unclear reasons\nRejections for loans, insurance, or rental applications can stem from inaccurate or outdated data in broker databases. If your reputation or credit score is being shaped by information you didn't even know existed, that's a clear signal that your data is out of your hands.\nCUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE\nHow to stay safe: Steps to protect your data now\nNoticing just a few of these signs means it's time to take action. The more proactive you are, the better you can limit future damage and prevent your data from spreading further.\n1. Invest in a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can request that your information be taken down from hundreds of data broker sites. It's an effective way to remove your name from public listings and stop new profiles from popping up. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\n2. Strengthen your passwords: Use long, unique passwords that are different for every account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\n3. Turn on two-factor authentication: Adding a second step to your login process, like a text code or app confirmation, can stop hackers even if they know your password. Turn this on for email, banking, and any service that stores your sensitive info.\n4. Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements every few days. Set up alerts for any activity, and if you're not actively applying for credit, consider freezing your credit reports with all three bureaus.\n5. Use alias email addresses: Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking. This helps keep your primary inbox private and makes it easier to trace which services may be leaking or selling your information. If one alias starts receiving junk mail or suspicious messages, you can simply delete it without affecting your main account. It's one of the simplest ways to reduce spam and protect your digital identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services here.\n6. Don't click suspicious links or attachments, and use strong antivirus software: Phishing attempts often look convincing, especially if scammers already know your name or other details. If something feels off, delete the message and go directly to the website instead of clicking the link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n7. Be cautious about what you post publicly: Avoid sharing your birthday, hometown, full name, or photos of your home or license plates. Social media platforms are heavily scraped by bots and bad actors looking to compile detailed profiles.\n8. Block robocalls and filter scam numbers: A surge in robocalls is a strong sign your phone number is being sold or shared by data brokers. These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include fake IRS agents, tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam. Check out how to get rid of robocalls with apps and data removal services.\nWHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE\nKurt's key takeaways\nYour personal data is valuable, and once it's out there, it's difficult, sometimes impossible, to claw it back. But you're not powerless. The more proactive you are, the safer you'll be. Start by cleaning up your digital footprint and removing your information from people finder and data broker sites. Whether you go manual or use a trusted service, acting now can help you avoid bigger problems later.

I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.\n\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.\n\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.\n\"I have great virus software on all my devices and use two-step authentication for almost everything - but I still almost fell for it. I'm sharing this story to help others.\"\nPamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.\nBeware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC\nScammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.\nIf you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.\nProtect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords\nMake sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password. Consider using a password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\nGOOGLE'S AI UNLEASHES POWERFUL SCAM-BUSTING FEATURES FOR ANDROID\nDon’t fall for urgency: How scammers pressure you to act fast\nScammers will create a false sense of urgency to make you act quickly without thinking. Take your time to verify any urgent requests, especially those involving money or personal information. Don't act on impulse.\nCheck URLs carefully before you click them, and use strong antivirus software\nVerify links before clicking them, especially if they come from someone who randomly contacted you on the internet. Scammers often use URLs that look similar to legitimate sites, but they typically contain slight misspellings or different domains (e.g., payepal.com or Microsoft.xyz). Also, install and update strong antivirus software.\nProtect all your devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones, with strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\nDON’T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX\nAlways update the software you use\nBe sure each operating system, browser, and security software you use is updated on your computers and mobile devices. These updates often include patches that fix security vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit.\nBe cautious with personal information on social media\nThink twice before sharing personal details, such as your birthday, address, or even your pet's name. Scammers can use information from your social media profiles to guess passwords or craft personalized phishing attacks.\nHOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts\nDon't limit MFA to just your main accounts. Enable it wherever possible, including email, social media, and financial services. Multifactor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for scammers to gain access, even if they have your password.\nUse a personal data removal service to clean up your online footprint\nScammers often scour the internet for your personal information. Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy.\nThese services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\nRegularly review your financial statements and credit reports\nMonitor your bank accounts, credit cards, and credit reports for any unusual or unauthorized activity. Early detection is key. If you spot something suspicious, report it immediately to your financial institution and the proper authorities.\nBack up your important data regularly\nRansomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.\nReport online scams to these official authorities\nIf you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the FTC, your local FBI office, the IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.\nKurt's key takeaways\nKeep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts.

            "11 easy ways to protect your online privacy in 2025. Privacy is getting harder to protect in a world where everything is connected.\nWhether you're chatting with an AI, checking your email or using your smartphone, your personal information is constantly being collected, tracked and sometimes even sold.\nBut protecting your privacy in 2025 doesn't have to be overwhelming. With a few practical steps, you can take back control of your data and make your online life safer. This guide walks you through 11 easy ways to get started.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide free when you join.\n1. Don’t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT\nAI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.\nSCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST 1 CHATGPT SEARCH\nTip: Treat all online forms of AI interaction like public forums. Keep your examples generic and use caution with anything that could identify you.\nIf you're going to input your personal information while using these AI tools, ensure there is an option to prevent them from sharing it. On ChatGPT, for instance, do the following:\n- Go to Settings.\n- Click Data controls.\n- Tap Improve the model for everyone.\n- Toggle off Improve the model for everyone.\n- Click Done.\nWhy it matters: AI tools may seem personal, but they’re not secure vaults. Guarding what you share helps prevent misuse, identity theft or data leaks from breaches.\nCLEAN UP YOUR PHONE: SPEED, STORAGE AND PRIVACY BOOST IN MINUTES\n2. Use alias email addresses\nYour email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.\nMy top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.\nIn addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.\nSometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. See my review of the best secure and private email services here.\nWhy it matters: You stay anonymous, avoid data leaks and never have to change your main email address again.\nBEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS – CYBERGUY PICKS\n3. Take advantage of Facebook’s privacy checkup\nMeta frequently updates its privacy settings, so it's best to check regularly to see how you can improve your privacy. Use Facebook's Privacy Checkup tool to review and adjust crucial settings, including post visibility, app permissions, search visibility and friend-request settings. This comprehensive tool helps ensure your profile remains as private as you want it to be. You can find the tool by following these steps:\n- Log in to your Facebook app on your phone.\n- Then click the menu icon in the bottom right.\n- Tap Settings.\n- Click Privacy Checkup.\nOnce you open the Privacy Checkup, you'll be guided through several key areas to customize your privacy preferences and better control your information.\n- Who can see what you share: Adjust who can view your posts, photos and profile details to limit access to only people you trust.\n- How people can find you on Facebook: Manage who can send you friend requests, look you up using your email or phone number, and decide whether your profile appears in search engines.\n- Your data settings on Facebook: Review which apps and websites have access to your Facebook data and remove any you no longer use or trust.\n- How to keep your account secure: Set up two-factor authentication, update your password and monitor login alerts to protect your account from unauthorized access.\n- Your ad preferences on Facebook: Control how Facebook uses your activity to show you personalized ads and opt out of categories that feel too intrusive.\nQuick tip: Set a reminder to run a privacy checkup every few months, especially after major Facebook updates. This way, you’ll always be in control of your information.\nWhy it matters: Social media platforms thrive on your personal data. Adjusting your settings regularly puts you back in control of what others and Facebook can see and use.\nHOW TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON YOUR NEXT CRUISE VACATION\n4. Scrub yourself off the internet automatically\nYour name, phone number and home address may already be listed on people-search sites like Spokeo, Whitepages and BeenVerified. These data brokers collect and sell your personal information without you even knowing it. Fortunately, personal data removal services are available to protect your privacy. They automatically send legal removal requests to hundreds of data brokers. They also go above and beyond by continuously monitoring them in case these third parties happen to get your information again.\nWhile no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\nWhy it matters: The less personal information available about you online, the harder it is for scammers and identity thieves to target you and the more peace of mind you'll have.\n10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE’S SECURITY AND PRIVACY\n5. Use a privacy-focused messaging app\nIf you're still using standard texting apps or platforms like Facebook Messenger, it's time to upgrade to a more secure option. Apps like Signal and Session offer end-to-end encryption, no ads and no metadata tracking, meaning they can't see who you're talking to or what you're saying. Both apps support disappearing messages, giving you more control over how long your conversations stick around.\nWhy it matters: Your messages stay private and can't be accessed by hackers, advertisers or the app developers themselves.\n6. Stop Google from tracking your every move\nGoogle collects a massive amount of data from your searches, YouTube views, Gmail activity and location history, all of which fuels targeted advertising. You can stop much of this tracking by turning off Ad Personalization and deleting your activity history. Here's what to do:\n- Go to Google's My Ad Center.\n- Find the Ad Personalization section.\n- Toggle the switch to turn off ad personalization. This stops Google from using your activity to tailor ads.\nManage activity history\n- In My Ad Center or via your Google Account, go to Data & Privacy.\n- Under History Settings, review and pause or delete: Web & App Activity, YouTube History and Location History (if applicable).\nDelete existing activity data\n- Select Manage all Web & App Activity, Manage all YouTube History, etc.\n- Delete past activity by choosing a time range (e.g., \"All time\") and confirming deletion for each category.\nOpt out of third-party ad personalization\n- Scroll to Ad settings and look for third-party ad personalization options.\n- Opt out of partner sites' ad personalization if available.\n- If you have multiple Google accounts, repeat these steps for each account.\nWhy it matters: Cutting down on ad tracking reduces how much of your online behavior is used to build a profile on you, often without your knowledge.\n7. Turn off location tracking on your smartphone\nApps don't need to know your every move. Disabling or limiting location tracking is one of the simplest ways to protect your physical privacy. Here's what to do:\niPhone:\n- Go to Settings.\n- Tap Privacy & Security.\n- Click Location Services.\n- Scroll down and tap the app you want to manage.\n- Choose your preferred setting: Never to block location access completely; Ask Next Time Or When I Share to allow location only with your permission; While Using the App to allow location only when the app is open.\nFor apps like Maps, toggle Precise Location off to prevent pinpoint tracking.\nTo disable location tracking entirely, toggle Location Services off at the top of the Location Services page (this will stop all apps from using your location).\nAndroid:\nSettings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer.\n- Go to Settings.\n- Tap Location.\n- Tap App permissions or App location permissions.\n- You will see a list of apps grouped by their location access: Allowed all the time; Allowed only while in use; Ask every time; Not allowed.\n- Tap any app to change its location permission. Choose from: Allow all the time; Allow only while using the app; Ask every time; Don't allow.\nFor apps that have location access, you can also turn Precise location on or off if you want to limit accuracy. Repeat for each app you want to manage.\nTip: If you want to stop all apps from accessing your location, you can turn off Location at the top of the Location settings page.\nWhy it matters: Prevents apps, advertisers and even your OS from building a detailed map of your daily routines.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n8. Change the default admin password on your router\nMost routers ship with default admin usernames and passwords like \"admin\" or \"1234,\" and these are publicly available online. Hackers know this and often scan networks looking for unprotected routers. Here's what to do:\n- Log in to your router's settings via its IP address (often 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).\n- Change the admin username and password to something strong and unique.\n- Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\nWhy it matters: Prevents intruders from hijacking your home network and spying on your devices.\n9. Enable WPA3 encryption on your Wi-Fi router\nWPA3 is the newest wireless encryption protocol and offers much stronger protection than WPA2. If your router supports WPA3, enabling it is a no-brainer. How to check:\n- Log into your router settings and look under Wireless Security.\n- If WPA3 is available, enable it.\n- If not, consider upgrading to a newer, security-focused router. Check out our top routers for best security 2025.\nWhy it matters: Stronger encryption means hackers can't easily intercept or crack your Wi-Fi traffic.\n10. Set up a guest network for visitors and smart devices\nYour friends don't need access to your entire home network and neither do your smart lights and doorbells. Creating a guest network adds a safety barrier between your personal devices and less trustworthy ones. Steps to take:\n- Log into your router settings.\n- Create a separate guest network with its own password.\n- Connect smart devices, TVs and guests to this network only.\n- Keep your main network just for personal computers and phones.\nWhy it matters: Even if a smart device gets compromised, the attacker won't have access to your main network or sensitive devices.\n11. Use a secure, private browser for sensitive browsing\nNot all browsers treat your privacy equally. Switching to a browser designed for privacy like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo's browser can drastically cut down on the amount of data collected about you while you browse. Also, use incognito/private mode for sensitive searches.\nWhy it matters: Reduces digital fingerprints and helps stop advertisers and data brokers from building a profile on you based on your browsing behavior.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nKurt’s key takeaways\nStaying private online isn't about being paranoid; it's about making smart, intentional choices. With the right tools and a few small changes, you can take back control of your data in 2025. Digital privacy is always changing, so it's a good idea to check your settings and habits every so often.

Defense says the move hurts jury’s diversity Nation Jun 16, 2025 4:06 PM EDT NEW YORK (AP) — A judge dismissed a juror in the sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs on Monday after concluding that his conflicting answers about where he lives might indicate he had an agenda or wanted to stay on the jury for a purpose. Judge Arun Subramanian made the ruling after rejecting arguments by Combs’ attorneys that it would disrupt the diversity of the jury to replace the Black man with a white juror. READ MORE: A timeline of Diddy’s career and legal troubles Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges after his September arrest at a New York hotel. He was denied bail multiple times and has remained incarcerated at a federal lockup in Brooklyn ever since. Subramanian had first announced late Friday that he was dismissing the juror after questions arose over whether he resided in New York or New Jersey most of the time, but multiple defense lawyers protested and the judge waited until Monday to announce his final decision. The judge said a review of the juror’s answers to questions about his residency during jury selection, along with his subsequent responses to similar questions in the robing room, revealed “clear inconsistencies.” “Taking these all together, the record raised serious concerns as to the juror’s candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury,” he said. Subramanian said to leave the juror on the panel could threaten the integrity of the judicial process, and he rejected a defense request that he question him further, saying it could lead to “another set of shifting answers. … In other words, there’s nothing that the juror can say at this point that would put the genie back in the bottle and restore his credibility.” The judge expressed disappointment that the defense asked him again in a weekend letter to consider the racial makeup of the jury in his ruling as it accused prosecutors of misconduct. “The court should not, indeed cannot, let race factor into the decision of what happens. Here, the answer is clear. Juror No. 6 is excused,” Subramanian said before the jury, minus Juror No. 6, was brought into the courtroom for the resumption of testimony. Defense lawyers in the letter also accused prosecutors of misconduct in a “coordinated effort to try to destroy one of the most successful Black men in American history.” “The government’s case is all about his personal life, and what he and his romantic partners have done in the privacy of the bedroom,” the lawyers wrote. “There has been no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct brought to the court’s attention. Zero,” the judge said, rejecting the defense’s third request for a mistrial. Prosecutors have said they expect to rest sometime this week. The trial is in its sixth week. On Monday, prosecutors called what’s known as a summary witness to read aloud numerous text messages that jurors hadn’t previously heard. They included exchanges in which the woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” complained to Combs about their “hotel night” and “wild king night” sex marathon lifestyle and to his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, about his threats to release explicit videos of her having sex with other men. Jane, who dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest last year, excoriated the hip-hop star in a series of text messages after his former longtime girlfriend Cassie, the R&B singer whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit against him alleging years of sexual abuse, control and violence. On Nov. 28, 2023, about two weeks after Combs settled the lawsuit, Jane told him that she felt he exploited her with their “dark and humiliating lifestyle.” She wrote that for the three years they were together, she felt confused by their relationship and that being with Combs had deprived her of work opportunities. A month later, Jane texted Khorram that Combs “just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has on two phones. He said he would send them to my baby daddy.” Jane noted that she didn’t typically involve Khorram in such matters, but said she needed help because Combs was having one of his “evil-ass psychotic bipolar” episodes and, along with threatening her, was saying he’d call the police on her. Jane told Khorram that she was heavily drugged in the tapes. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times. Give Now By — Michael R.

            "17 biggest Diddy trial bombshells &mdash; as the prosecution readies to rest its case. - It's the sixth week of testimony in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.\n- Combs' two sex-trafficking accusers have testified, and the prosecution will soon rest.\n- Here are 17 of the biggest revelations from the trial so far.\nIt's week six of the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.\nA federal jury in Manhattan has heard R&B singer Cassie Ventura — Combs' ex-girlfriend and the catalyst for his public downfall — tearfully testify about the humiliating \"freak offs\" she says she endured throughout their 11-year relationship.\nA second sex-assault accuser, who testified as \"Mia,\" described four times she says Combs attacked her, and a third accuser. The third accuser, \"Jane,\" testified about the alleged violence underlying what prosecutors say were her three years as Combs' sex-trafficking victim.\nAlong the way, there have been numerous celebrity mentions, including pop icon Britney Spears, actor Michael B. Jordan, rapper Kid Cudi, and late music legend Prince.\nCombs was arrested in September on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution — the culmination of months of lawsuits and public accusations of sexual assault and other misconduct.\nThe music tycoon is arguing through his defense team that all sexual encounters were consensual, including the alleged drug-fueled freak offs at the trial's center — and that any violence fell short of sex trafficking.\nHere are some of the most striking moments from the trial so far.\nKanye West granted VIP courtroom access\nYe, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has been given special access to attend his pal Combs' trial.\nThe \"Jesus Walks\" rapper has been added to Combs' friends and family trial guest list, according to two sources with knowledge of the document.\nYe showed up to court to support Combs during the trial's fifth week, but was denied entry to the Manhattan courtroom.\n\"He did not wait in line like everybody else from the public,\" a court source previously told BI. \"No one gets special treatment.\"\nYe was instead seated in an overflow room on the courthouse's 23rd floor — three floors below where Combs' trial is unfolding — and left after listening to about half an hour of testimony.\nIt's not clear whether Ye will be back to support Combs at his trial, but if he does, he will have a seat available alongside Combs' family members in the courtroom.\nDiddy's ex says he beat her a month after he apologized for Cassie abuse\nIn May 2024, shortly after CNN aired hotel surveillance video showing Combs dragging Ventura down a hallway and beating her, the rapper posted an apology on Instagram.\nOn video, Combs told his followers that his behavior that day was \"inexcusable\" — and that he began therapy soon after the 2016 hotel incident.\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" he said in his Instagram video.\nOn June 9, however, Combs' ex testified that exactly one month after he posted that apology, he abused her, leaving her face covered in bruises.\nAfter the abuse, she said, Combs leaned close to her and asked her: \"Is this coercion?\"\nThe woman, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said he then demanded she put on makeup, pop an ecstasy pill, and have sex with a male escort.\n\"Take this fucking pill. You're not going to ruin my fucking night,\" Jane said Combs demanded as she screamed, \"I don't want to! I don't want to!\"\nProsecutors say Combs sex trafficked Ventura and Jane by means of false promises, violence, and coercion.\nJane's and other trial witnesses' testimony contradicts the story she says Combs told people close to him after the CNN video was released.\nJane testified that when the news broke, Combs \"huddled\" with his team and his family.\n\"He said that that was the only time that they had physical violence like that,\" Jane said of the abuse between Combs and Ventura. \"He said that she was a hitter and she would hit.\nAt trial, the jury has heard testimony from multiple witnesses describing more than a dozen times they said Combs physically abused Ventura between 2008 and 2018.\nA witness said Combs personally counted a $100K bribe to kill the Cassie hotel video\nA former security guard described Combs personally pulling $100,000 out of a paper bag and counting it, painting an image that's both surprising and legally significant.\nThe guard said Combs hoped the cash — prosecutors call it a bribe — would bury forever a 15-minute video showing him beating Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in March, 2016.\nCombs fed \"stacks of $10,000 at a time\" into a money-counting machine, then stuffed it back in the paper bag, according to the ex-guard, Eddy Garcia.\nThe ex-guard said Combs then handed him the bag as payment for a USB thumb drive containing what both men believed was the only copy of the incriminating footage.\n\"Eddy, my angel,\" the guard said Combs called him after the transaction.\n\"Something like this would ruin him,\" he said Combs told him.\nEight years later, a surviving copy of the video was first made public by CNN. Now, it's the single most important piece of evidence in the trial, both sides say.\nProsecutors say the video shows Combs in the very act of sex-trafficking Ventura, meaning coercing her through physical force into engaging in sex at the hotel with a male sex worker known only as \"Jewels.\"\nThe first charge in Combs' indictment accused him of racketeering, a charge that requires proof of at least two underlying crimes. Prosecutors may argue that the video alone is proof of three underlying crimes: sex trafficking, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\nProsecutors hope the video will also clinch the second charge in Combs' indictment, which accuses him of sex trafficking Ventura. Both racketeering and sex trafficking carry maximum sentences of life in prison.\nCombs raped his PA, \"Mia,\" as she slept in the staff room at his Beverly Hills mansion, she said\nOne of Combs' former personal assistants testified under the pseudonym \"Mia,\" telling jurors he sexually attacked her four times between 2009 and 2017, when she was in her mid-20s and early 30s.\nShe said that two of the attacks were at the sprawling glass and concrete mansion he rented in Beverly Hills, including a rape in the staff bedroom. She described waking to feeling Combs on top of her. \"Be quiet,\" she said he told her.\n\"I knew his power and I knew his control over me,\" she told the jury, her voice hushed and halting.\n\"And I didn't want to lose everything that I worked so hard for — or this, like, this world that was the only thing I had anymore.\"\nCombs beat Ventura outside a Prince party, Mia also told jurors\nCombs once attacked Ventura during a party thrown by music icon Prince, the former personal assistant also testified.\nThe ex-PA, who used the pseudonym \"Mia,\" told the jury she and Ventura had snuck out to Prince's Los Angeles home after learning he would be performing for a small gathering — a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience, as Ventura described it on the stand.\nPrince did not disappoint. Mia said that as he played music, they danced atop his backyard pool, which was backlit and covered in purple plexiglas.\nThen Combs showed up, she said.\n\"I saw his bucket hat come through the entrance and then made eye contact with him,\" Mia said of Combs. \"Me and Cass just booked it.\"\nThey ran through Prince's house and into the woods out front, where \"Puff caught Cass,\" and started beating her, Mia said, until Prince's security intervened.\nLater that night, Ventura testified that Combs continued to beat her back at her hotel, leaving her with \"bruising on my face, knots on my head.\"\nEx-employee Capricorn Clark testified Combs kidnapped her at gunpoint\nCapricorn Clark, another former personal assistant and one who became one of his top marketing executives, kicked off week three of the trial by telling jurors that he once kidnapped her at gunpoint.\nIt was December 2011, after Combs learned of rapper Kid Cudi's brief relationship with Ventura, Clark testified on May 27.\nCombs was \"furious\" with Clark for keeping him in the dark about Ventura's romance with the \"Pursuit of Happiness\" rapper, she said.\nClark told the jury that Combs, armed with a gun, went to her house in a rage and banged on the door.\n\"He just said, 'Get dressed, we're going to go kill'\" him, Clark testified that Combs told her, using the N-word to refer to Kid Cudi.\nCombs then took Clark to Kid Cudi's Los Angeles home, she told the jury, describing it as being \"kidnapped.\"\n\"The way he was acting, I just felt like anything could happen,\" a tearful Clark testified.\nEx-exec says years before \"freak offs\" Combs took Kim Porter to hotels too — with candles and baby oil\nIn the first week of trial testimony, Ventura told jurors that starting in late 2008, she was coerced by Combs into a decade's worth of near-weekly \"freak offs\" — dayslong sex performances, usually at luxury hotels, involving male escorts, Glade candles, and numerous bottles of baby oil.\nClark told jurors that in the years she was Combs personal assistant, from 2004 until 2006, she would set up and clean up the hotel rooms where Combs took another longterm girlfriend, model Kim Porter, the mother of four of Combs' children.\nDuring those years, Combs and Porter would stay for days at luxury hotels in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York. Clark said, as a personal assistant, she made sure Combs' suite was stocked with ecstasy, baby oil, and pricey Diptyque candles.\nCleanup was tricky, Clark told jurors, who mentioned \"handprints left in oil on the, like, ultra-suede wall\" as a particular problem. \"It was just a lot of baby oil. It was just everywhere.\"\nThese were not \"freak offs,\" Porter's former family attorney, Suzanne Kimberly Bracker, told Business Insider.\n\"He was madly in love with Kim,\" said Bracker, who helped negotiate Combs' child support settlement and who said that Porter had two children with Combs at the time.\n\"There is absolutely no way that he would share her with another man,\" she said. \"He would tell her 'I'm not gonna pay for an apartment with my kids in one room while you're with another guy in the other bedroom.'\"\nKid Cudi said Combs broke into his house and probably torched his Porsche\nKid Cudi took the witness stand in Combs' trial on May 22, telling jurors that in December 2011, the music tycoon broke into his Hollywood Hills home, enraged after finding out about the rival rapper's short-lived romance with Ventura.\nKid Cudi, given name Scott Mescudi, told the jury that he returned home after the break-in to find the Christmas gifts he'd planned to give his family unwrapped and opened. His dog, he said, had been shut in the bathroom.\n\"Motherfucker, you in my house?\" Mescudi recalled telling Combs over the phone as he raced home to confront him.\nCombs was gone by the time he arrived, Mescudi said.\nMescudi also told the jury that some two weeks later, his Porsche was firebombed while in his driveway.\nThe Porsche \"arson\" is a specific element in the racketeering charges against Combs. Prosecutors alleged in court papers that Combs ordered his underlings to torch a vehicle \"by slicing open the car's convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside the interior.\"\nCassie's mom describes 'trying to hit' Combs in a fight over her daughter's stolen phone\nRegina Ventura corroborated her daughter's testimony, telling jurors she witnessed the aftermath of two of Combs' violent, jealous rages over romantic rivals.\nThe first was in 2011. The mom said Cassie Ventura came home to Connecticut for the Christmas holidays with a large bruise on her back.\nCassie Ventura had told jurors the week before that the bruise was from being kicked to the ground by Combs during a fight over Mescudi.\nRegina Ventura also confirmed a 2016 incident from shortly before the younger Ventura's 30th birthday. Combs had swiped her cellphone, Cassie Ventura testified, after learning about her affair with an unnamed professional NFL player.\nWhen she returned to her Los Angeles apartment without her phone, her mother, who was visiting, called the police and confronted Combs outside the building as her daughter remained upstairs, the elder Ventura testified.\n\"I was yelling and screaming and trying to hit him,\" the mom told jurors. \"He did give it back,\" she told jurors of the missing phone.\nCassie screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?' as Combs attacked her on his private jet, ex-assistant says\nA former Combs personal assistant described watching — and doing nothing — as his boss brutally attacked a cowering Ventura in the bedroom of the rapper's private jet.\nGeorge Kaplan, 34, said the attack happened on a crowded flight to Las Vegas in the latter half of 2015. Kaplan said he heard the sound of screams and shattering glass coming from the jet's bedroom.\nHe said he turned to see Combs standing over Ventura with a \"whiskey rock glass\" in his hand, as she cowered on the bed.\n\"After the glass crashed, Ventura screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?'\" Kaplan told the jury.\n\"Did you look away?\" asked a federal prosecutor, Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey. Kaplan said he did.\n\"And after you looked away, what did you hear?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"Further glass crashing and chaos.\"\nWhen the prosecutor asked what, if anything, the Combs security staff did in response, Kaplan answered, \"Nothing.\"\nNo one, he said, went back to check on Ventura after Combs left the bedroom to rejoin his employees.\n\"I was 23 years old,\" Kaplan said in explanation of his own inaction. \"All I wanted to do was have a great job in the entertainment industry.\"\nUltimately, he told the jury, this and similar domestic violence incidents drove him to quit.\nAnother former personal assistant told of the night he said Diddy went looking for Suge Knight\nCombs' former personal assistant spent two days on the witness stand, and in his most dramatic testimony, described how a 2008 run for cheeseburgers at an all-night diner nearly escalated the East Coast-West Coast rap wars.\nIt started at 4 a.m. in the parking lot at Mel's Drive-In in Los Angeles, the ex-assistant, David James, testified.\nCombs' trusted security guard, Damian \"D-Roc\" Butler, noticed that Suge Knight, cofounder of rival recording studio Death Row Records, was sitting in an Escalade just a few parking spots away.\nJames, Combs' personal assistant from 2007 to 2009, testified that he was at the wheel of Combs' silver Lincoln Navigator when Knight and D-Roc faced off.\n\"What are you doing in my city?\" James, according to his testimony, remembered hearing Knight asking Combs' security guard, who had introduced himself as \"D-Roc, Biggie's boy,\" a reference to the rapper Notorious B.I.G.\nWithin moments, James and the bodyguard saw someone pass a gun to Knight and watched as four SUVs pulled up into different corners of the parking lot, he told jurors.\nJames testified that he was ordered by D-Roc to speed back to Combs' Hollywood Hills estate. There was no mention of whether they drove back with or without the cheeseburgers.\nOnce back home, and as Ventura protested in tears, Combs grabbed three guns for the ten-minute drive with D-Roc back to Mel's, testified James, who said he was still the driver.\nKnight was nowhere to be found upon their return, James said.\n\"It was the first time I realized my life was in danger,\" the former PA testified, telling jurors that he sent in his resignation soon after.\nDawn Richard testified about a brutal beating, an alleged death threat, and flowers\nDanity Kane singer Dawn Richard was the fifth prosecution witness, and her testimony on May 16 alleged that in 2009, Combs brutally beat Ventura after she took too long to cook him dinner.\n\"Where's my fucking egg?\" Richard recounted to the jury Combs shouting in 2009, as he stormed into the kitchen of his rented Los Angeles mansion.\n\"He took the skillet with the eggs in it and tried to hit her in the head, and she fell to the ground,\" Richard testified.\nVentura cowered on the floor \"in a fetal position\" as Combs punched her and kicked her, she testified. Then he dragged her upstairs by her hair, she said, adding that she then heard the sound of screaming and breaking glass from the third floor.\nThe next day, Combs called Ventura and Richard into the mansion's first-floor recording studio, she said.\n\"He said that what we saw was passion, and it was what lovers in a relationship do,\" Richard said.\nShe said Combs told the two women that \"he was trying to take us to the top, and that, where he comes from, people go missing if they say things like that, like, if people talk. And then he gave us flowers.\"\nWhile back on the stand on May 19, Richard re-emphasized that she felt this was a threat to her life.\nThe details in the testimony came as a surprise to Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who called it prejudicial and \"just a drop dead lie.\"\n\"It didn't happen,\" the lawyer complained to the judge. \"And the reason we know it didn't happen is that Ms. Ventura didn't talk about it\" during her four days on the witness stand.\nOn cross-examination on May 19, Richard agreed that she only recalled the alleged death threat in speaking with prosecutors earlier this month. It had gone unmentioned, she agreed, during a half-dozen prior interviews with prosecutors.\nCombs attacked Ventura over bathroom use, prosecutor and ex-bestie say\nVentura was beaten by Combs for the most minor of perceived infractions, including taking too long in the bathroom, prosecutor Emily Johnson said in her opening statement.\n\"He beat her when she didn't answer the phone when he called. He beat her when she left a freak off without his permission,\" Johnson said.\nVentura's ex-best friend, Kerry Morgan, was called to the witness stand on May 19 and told jurors about two attacks on Ventura she witnessed, including one while on vacation in Jamaica in 2013.\nMorgan said Ventura at one point went to the bathroom at the residence where they were staying, and Combs said, \"She's taking too long.\"\n\"A few minutes later, I heard her screaming — like guttural. Terrifying,\" Morgan said. \"He was dragging her by her hair on the floor.\"\nMorgan told jurors that she saw Combs push Ventura to the ground, causing her to hit her head on the paving bricks.\n\"She didn't move. She fell on her side,\" Morgan said, adding, \"I thought she was knocked out.\"\nVentura, too, had testified that arguments with Combs would regularly result in physical abuse.\nVentura —who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018 — described six separate times when Combs' attacks left her with injuries, with the most severe beating occurring in Los Angeles in 2009 following a party Combs had hosted at a club called Ace of Diamonds.\nVentura said she punched Combs in the face after he called her a \"slut or a bitch\" for talking to a record producer. Combs retaliated in the back seat of a chauffeured luxury vehicle by punching and kicking Ventura throughout a ten-minute ride to the rapper's rented mansion, she said.\nShe said she hid under the back seat to escape the attack. Combs demanded she stay hidden in a hotel for a week so her bruises could heal, she said.\nThe surprising things Combs kept in his luxury NYC hotel room while waiting to be arrested\nThe prosecution's fourth witness took the witness stand briefly on May 16 to detail what she and other Homeland Security investigators say they found inside Combs' suite at Manhattan's Park Hyatt New York after his September arrest.\nCombs had checked into the luxury Midtown hotel, his lawyers have said, in case federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked him to surrender voluntarily.\nSpecial Agent Yasin Binda told the Combs jury she photographed what her colleagues found inside the room.\nThose items included a clear plastic bag of baby oil bottles found inside a duffle bag. There were three more bottles of baby oil in his bathtub, alongside two bottles of personal lubricant.\nTwo more bottles of lubricant were recovered from a nightstand drawer, next to a prescription pill bottle she said held two small baggies containing a pink powder.\nOn the living room floor was a large blue party light of the kind Ventura testified were used to illuminate freak offs.\nSimilar bags of pink powder have previously been seized from Combs and tested positive for ecstasy and other drugs, a prosecutor had said in court the day after Combs was arrested.\nVentura's big settlements after her lawsuit and that infamous hallway-beatdown video\nIn some of her final moments on the witness stand, Ventura was asked by the defense about a legal settlement that she said she is on the verge of receiving from the InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles.\n\"I think it was $10 million,\" Ventura said of the settlement, hesitating when asked for the total amount agreed to.\nThe InterContinental is where security cameras captured Combs beating Ventura in a hallway in 2016, as she tried to flee what prosecutors say was one of Combs' freak offs.\nThe jury was shown the infamous footage at the beginning of the trial.\nJohnson, the prosecutor, said in her opening statements that at the time of the attack, Combs paid a security guard at the hotel $100,000 in a brown paper envelope in exchange for the footage.\nCombs apologized for his actions in the video after CNN published the footage last year.\nIt was the second big-money settlement revealed in Ventura's testimony.\nEarlier in her testimony, Ventura told jurors that Combs paid her $20 million to settle her civil suit against him in 2023.\nBritney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were among the celebrities mentioned at the trial\nPop icon Britney Spears and actor Michael B. Jordan were both name-dropped on May 15, on Ventura's third day of testimony.\nDuring a cross-examination, Ventura was asked to tell the jury about the 21st birthday party Combs threw for her in 2007, at a club in Las Vegas.\nThe party was a significant moment in the Combs-Ventura story. Ventura testified that Combs, who recently signed her to his record label, gave her an uninvited kiss in a bathroom, sparking their relationship.\n\"I believe there were other celebrities there in attendance?\" defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura, who answered yes, there were.\n\"Sean was there, and he brought Dallas Austin, he brought Britney Spears,\" Ventura said, referring to the \"Oops!… I Did It Again\" singer and the record producer. \"I think those were the two people that stand out to me,\" Ventura added.\nAsked how a 21-year-old of limited fame was able to attract such big names to her party, Ventura credited Combs, saying, \"That was all him.\"\nJordan's name came up as the cross-examination focused on 2015, when Combs became suspicious that she was having an affair with the actor.\n\"Is Michael B. Jordan a celebrity?\" Estevao asked.\n\"I would say so,\" Ventura answered, sounding surprised.\nVentura said she first joined Diddy's freak offs out of love\nVentura testified on May 13 that she was initially nervous, but felt a sense of responsibility to participate in Combs' freak offs.\n\"I was just in love and wanted to make him happy,\" Ventura told the jury.\nVentura testified that in 2007, Combs first proposed \"this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism, where he would watch me have a sexual encounter with a third man, specifically another man.\"\n\"I didn't want to upset him if I said it scared me or if I said anything aside from, 'OK, let's try it,'\" she said.\nJohnson said in her opening statements that Combs eventually made it Ventura's job to find and book escorts to participate in the sex encounters.\nWhile on the stand, Ventura described in detail what went on during freak offs. Prosecutors say Combs arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded the sex performances.\nVentura testified that Combs would urinate and ask escorts to urinate on her during the freak offs.\n\"It was disgusting. It was too much. It was overwhelming,\" she said. \"I choked.\"\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673) or visit its website to receive confidential support.",

The split verdict meted out a measure of vindication to his accusers and prosecutors — but also to Weinstein — after the landmark case was thrown into limbo. Weinstein’s initial conviction five years ago seemed to cement the downfall of one of Hollywood’s most powerful men in a pivotal moment for the #MeToo movement. But that conviction was overturned last year, and the case was sent back for retrial in the same Manhattan courthouse. This time, a majority-female jury convicted the former studio boss of forcibly subjecting one to a criminal sex act in 2006. But jurors acquitted Weinstein of another criminal sex act charge from 2006. And jurors were to continue deliberating on a charge that he raped another woman in 2013. Under New York law, the third-degree rape charge carries a lesser penalty than the first-degree criminal sex act offense. Weinstein, 73, denies sexually assaulting or raping anyone. Jury deliberations had teetered Wednesday as the foreperson again requested to speak to the judge about “a situation” he found troubling. The man — who complained Monday that other jurors were pushing people to change their minds and talking about information beyond the charges — was being questioned in private, at his request. While the jury was in court to hear the answer to an earlier request to re-hear the text of a rape law, the foreperson signaled to Judge Curtis Farber that he wanted to talk. “He said words to the effect of ‘I can’t go back in there with the other jurors,’” Farber explained later. The foreperson was sent to wait in a separate room, where he penned a note saying, “I need to talk to you about a situation.” When briefly brought into court, the foreperson said he wanted to speak in private. He, the judge, prosecutors and Weinstein’s lawyers then went behind closed doors. The discussion was closed to the press and public, but Farber later said the foreperson had expressed that he didn’t want to change his position — whatever it may be — and was being bullied. “He did indicate that at least one other juror made comments to the effect of ‘I’ll meet you outside one day,’ and there’s yelling and screaming,” the judge said. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala characterized the foreperson’s concerns more severely, saying that the man had said he was concerned for his safety after his fellow panelist talked about meeting him outside and added, “you don’t know me.” “I don’t think the court is protecting this juror.

            "Milky Way&#8217;s chance of colliding with Andromeda galaxy is less than previously thought, astronomers report. By — Marcia Dunn, Associated Press Marcia Dunn, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/milky-ways-chance-of-colliding-with-andromeda-galaxy-is-less-than-previously-thought-astronomers-report Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Milky Way’s chance of colliding with Andromeda galaxy is less than previously thought, astronomers report Science Jun 2, 2025 2:51 PM EDT CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all. Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That’s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time. “As it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,” the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy. While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity. “We likely won’t live to see the benefit,” lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email. Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn’t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away. Sawala’s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash. WATCH: How a newly discovered galaxy could offer clues on how our Milky Way Galaxy formed Past theories put a collision between the two — resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda — as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner. For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way’s movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances. Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years. “The fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest — not just to astronomers,” said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy’s name. More work is needed before the Milky Way’s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what’s happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos. While our galaxy’s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun’s future is “pretty much sealed,” according to Sawala. “Of course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That’s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time. “As it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,” the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy. While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity. “We likely won’t live to see the benefit,” lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email. Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn’t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away. Sawala’s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency’s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash. WATCH: How a newly discovered galaxy could offer clues on how our Milky Way Galaxy formed Past theories put a collision between the two — resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda — as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner. For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way’s movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances. Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years. “The fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest — not just to astronomers,” said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy’s name. More work is needed before the Milky Way’s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what’s happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos. While our galaxy’s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun’s future is “pretty much sealed,” according to Sawala. “Of course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.” Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

How two satellites are mimicking total solar eclipses in space\nA pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.\nThe European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday.

Ghazala Hashmi won the Democratic nomination for the position on Wednesday.\nHashmi is the first Muslim and the first Indian-American to be nominated to appear on the ballot for a Virginia statewide office. She defeated five other candidates, including Democrat Levar Stoney by less than a percentage point, to secure the nomination in a razor-thin primary race. Stoney congratulated Hashmi on Wednesday in a concession statement.\nHashmi will now face Republican John Reid, the first openly gay man to receive a major party’s endorsement for statewide office in Virginia, who became the de-facto nominee after his primary opponent left the race.\nHer victory rounded out the Democratic ticket ahead of the November general election. It comes after former Del. Jay Jones became the party nominee for attorney general late Tuesday.\n“As the Democratic ticket running to serve as Virginia’s next Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General, we are united in our focus on the issues that matter to our fellow Virginians,” Hashmi, Jones and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the nominee for governor, said in a joint statement Wednesday morning.\nVirginia’s off-year elections typically draw national attention as a possible bellwether for politicians as they head into midterms in 2026. And this year, the election is also sure to make history.\nSpanberger, who ran for the Democratic nomination unopposed, will battle Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race. The female nominees all but guarantee that Virginia will have a woman for governor, which is a first in the state’s some 250-year history dating back to Patrick Henry’s governorship.\nConservatives did not hold statewide primaries this year, with only one candidate in each statewide contest advancing to the general election ballot.\nEarle-Sears became the Republican gubernatorial nominee after conservatives Dave LaRock and Amanda Chase failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Both LaRock and Chase initially challenged Earle-Sears for not being fully aligned with the White House.\nReid, a conservative talk-radio host, secured the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor despite intraparty quarreling over whether he was tied to a social media account reposting pornography, a charge he vehemently denied.\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares sailed to his spot on the ballot after announcing his reelection bid.\nRoughly 481,000 votes have been counted so far in the lieutenant governor’s Democratic primary, and about 479,000 in the contest for attorney general.\nThe races appear to be on track to match Democratic turnout for the statewide primary in 2021. But in that election, a wide field of candidates vying for governor was on the ballot. With Spanberger as the nominee, only Hashmi and Jones faced contested statewide primaries.\nHashmi’s political career has been marked by its fair share of firsts: she was the first Muslim woman and the first South Asian American in Virginia’s upper chamber.\nShe emigrated from India to Georgia when she was four years old, later moving to Richmond after getting a doctorate in American literature. She spent most of her career as a professor, first at the University of Richmond and then at Reynolds Community College.\nThe Democrat managed to distinguish herself by touting her legislative chops.

Virginia Democrats set to pick nominees in closely watched 2025 primaries\nSix candidates in Virginia are competing to become the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor\nRICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia Democrats are set on Tuesday to pick their nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general, rounding out the statewide ticket and setting the stage for a bellwether election later this year.\nMost of the nominees slated to be at the top of the November ticket have already been picked, and Republicans aren’t even having a statewide primary.\nIn the race for governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, whose candidacy thwarted prospective primary challengers, will go up against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — the only Republican who qualified for the ballot. Republicans have also solidified nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general.\nVirginia is one of two states that host statewide elections the year after a presidential election — New Jersey is the other — and the races are typically seen as referendums on the party in power before Congress heads into midterm elections.\nAnalysts will be looking for clues in both states about voter sentiment with President Donald Trump back in the Oval Office and Republicans controlling power in Washington.\nDemocrats’ hold on Virginia has slipped in recent years, moving it close to swing-state status nationally. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin beat former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021. And although Democrats narrowly gained back complete control of the legislature in a 2023 election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won Virginia last year by less than six points, compared to former President Joe Biden’s 10-point lead in 2020.\nStill, Democrats have history on their side: The party of the sitting president typically suffers defeat in Virginia’s statewide races. And considering Trump has never won the state, Democrats are probably better positioned to make gains once their ticket solidifies.\nThe six Democrats vying to be Virginia’s next lieutenant governor aren’t all that different on the issues: They support rights to abortion, a living wage, affordable housing and accessible health care. They also share similar criticisms of Trump.\nThe candidates notably fracture along regional lines, and distinctions emerge in what they have emphasized in stump speeches along the campaign trail.\nFormer Richmond City Mayor Levar Stoney has touted his ties to the Democratic Party and experience working under former Govs. Mark Warner and Terry McAuliffe. U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg endorsed his campaign in June.\nState Sen. Ghazala Hashmi is also from the Richmond area, representing part of the city and suburbs. Hashmi has pushed reproductive health in her bid and has been endorsed by abortion rights political action committees.\nVirginia Sen. Aaron Rouse, from Virginia Beach with ties to southwest Virginia, has also highlighted his legislative accomplishments.\nPrince William County School Board Chair Barbur Lateef, former federal prosecutor Victor Salgado and retired U.S. Department of Labor worker Alex Bastani are from northern Virginia.\nLateef, an eye surgeon, has honed in on education and health care. Salgado has stressed the importance of strengthening democracy, and Bastani has emphasized labor rights.\nFormer Del. Jay Jones and Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor are seeking to be the next attorney general.\nJones, who once represented Norfolk in the House of Delegates, comes from a long line of Hampton Roads politicians. His father was also a delegate, and his grandfather was the first Black member of the Norfolk School Board. Jones previously ran for attorney general in 2021 but lost the primary to Democratic incumbent Mark Herring.\nTaylor has served more than a decade as the top prosecutor in the suburbs outside Richmond after flipping the open seat in 2011. Notable cases include when she was appointed special prosecutor in the case of the torch-carrying mob in the fatal 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist riot. She took one of the torch carriers to trial, records show, but the case was dismissed after a hung verdict.\nOnly one Republican candidate in each statewide contest is advancing to the ballot.\nEarle-Sears became the gubernatorial nominee after Republicans Dave LaRock and Amanda Chase failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Both LaRock and Chase initially challenged Earle-Sears for not being fully aligned with Trump.\nConservative talk-radio host John Reid became the de facto nominee for lieutenant governor after his primary opponent left the race, and despite intraparty quarreling over whether he was tied to a social media account reposting pornography.\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares sailed to his spot on the ballot after announcing his reelection bid.\nAll 100 seats of the House of Delegates are up for election in November, and some nomination contests are taking place in Virginia’s more competitive districts.\nDemocrats May Nivar and Andrew Schear are racing to take on Republican incumbent Del. David Owen in a Richmond-area district that House liberals are vying to flip.\nThree Democrats are running to battle Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in a Petersburg-area district.\nTwo Republicans and two Democrats will have separate primaries to fill a competitive seat in the Chesapeake area, which opened after Republican Rep. Baxter Ennis announced his retirement.\n___\nOlivia Diaz is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Israeli-supported group says they were aid workers World Jun 12, 2025 2:38 PM EDT CAIRO (AP) — A unit of Gaza’s Hamas-run police force said it killed 12 members of an Israeli-backed Palestinian militia after detaining them early Thursday. An Israel-supported aid group, however, said the dead were its aid workers, eight of whom were killed when Hamas attacked their bus. It was not immediately possible to verify the competing claims or confirm the identities of those killed. The militia, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, said its fighters had attacked Hamas and killed five militants but made no mention of its own casualties. It also accused Hamas of detaining and killing aid workers. The deaths were the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private contractor that Israel says will replace the U.N. in distributing food to Gaza’s more than 2 million people. The past two weeks, dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded in near daily shootings as they try to reach GHF centers, with witnesses saying Israeli troops nearby have repeatedly opened fire. On Wednesday, at least 13 people were killed and 170 wounded when Israeli forces fired toward a crowd of Palestinians near a GHF center in central Gaza, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The military said it fired warning shots overnight at a gathering that posed a threat, hundreds of meters (yards) from the aid site. Internet and phone lines, meanwhile, were down across Gaza, according to telecom provider Paltel and the Palestinian telecoms authority. They said a key line was severed during an Israeli operation and that the military would not allow technicians into the area to repair it. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said emergency services were cut off because of the outage, and civilians cannot call ambulances. It said most U.N. agencies and aid groups could not reach their staff on the ground. ‘They were aid workers’ Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza, making it difficult to confirm what happened in the killings early Wednesday near the southern city of Khan Younis. GHF said Hamas attacked a bus carrying more than two dozen of its Palestinian aid workers, killing at least eight and wounding others. It said it feared some had been abducted. “We condemn this heinous and deliberate attack in the strongest possible terms,” it said. “These were aid workers. Humanitarians. Fathers, brothers, sons, and friends, who were risking their lives every day to help others.” The Israeli military circulated GHF’s statement but declined to provide its own account of what happened. Rev. Johnnie Moore, a Christian evangelical adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who was recently appointed head of GHF, called the killings “absolute evil.” READ MORE: Gaza health officials say 55,000 Palestinians have died in Israel-Hamas war The U.N.’s OCHA said it could not confirm the circumstances of the killings but said “civilians must never be attacked, let alone those trying to access or provide food amid mass starvation.” GHF says its staff at the centers include unarmed Palestinian employees. Much of the staff are armed international contractors, mainly Americans, guarding the centers. The Abu Shabab group fighters are deployed inside the Israeli military zones that surround the GHF centers, according to witnesses. Earlier this week, witnesses said Abu Shabab militiamen had opened fire on people en route to a GHF aid hub, killing and wounding many. GHF says it does not work with the Abu Shabab group. Last week, Israel acknowledged it is supporting armed groups of Palestinians opposed to Hamas. Hamas says it killed traitors Hamas has rejected the GHF system and threatened to kill any Palestinians who cooperate with the Israeli military. The Sahm police unit, which Hamas says it established to combat looting, released video footage showing several dead men lying in the street, saying they were Abu Shabab fighters who had been detained and killed for collaborating with Israel. It was not possible to verify the images or the claims around them. Mohammed Abu Amin, a Khan Younis resident who was at the scene, said a crowd celebrated the killings, shouting “God is greatest” and condemning those killed as traitors. Ghassan Duhine, who identifies himself as deputy commander of the Abu Shabab group and a major in the Palestinian Authority’s security forces, issued a statement saying Abu Shabab fighters had clashed with Sahm and killed five. He denied that the bodies in Sahm’s images were the group’s fighters. The Palestinian Authority, led by rivals of Hamas and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has denied any connection to the Abu Shabab group. But many of the militiamen identify themselves as PA officers. Aid initiative already marred by controversy Aid workers say Gaza is at risk of famine because of Israel’s renewed military campaign and its 2 1/2 month ban o n imports of food, fuel, medicine to Gaza, which was slightly eased in mid-May. OCHA warned that fuel “may very soon run out” at 67 of the 85 remaining partially functioning hospitals and health care centers in Gaza, meaning vital equipment would go dead. Despite the easing of the blockade, Israel has still not allowed fuel to enter. OCHA said the military gave it permission to retrieve fuel stored in northern Gaza after weeks of denials, but the team sent Wednesday had to turn back because of Israeli shelling in the area. The United Nations and major aid groups have rejected the GHF distribution system. They say it is unable to meet Gaza’s needs and allows Israel to use food as a weapon to enact its military objectives, including plans to move Gaza’s entire population to southern Gaza near the GHF hubs. Some fear this could be part of an Israeli plan to coerce Palestinians into leaving Gaza. Israel and the United States say the new system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid from the long-standing U.N.-run system. U.N. officials deny there has been any systematic diversion of aid by Hamas. The Israeli military on Thursday released what it said were seized Hamas documents showing it takes aid. One document, apparently showing minutes from a meeting last year, included an item saying the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ armed wing, had previously taken 25% of the aid but had agreed to settle for 7%, with 4% going to the Hamas-run government and 4% to the political movement. It did not specify the source or quantity of the aid. Israel did not release the entire document. The documents also detailed Hamas’ efforts to keep traders from hoarding goods and charging inflated prices for them. One of them appeared to acknowledge that some such traders had links to Hamas. The Associated Press could not confirm the documents’ authenticity. Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many of those killed were civilians or combatants. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. They are still holding 53 captives, less than half of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

An Israel-supported aid group, however, said the dead were its aid workers, eight of whom were killed when Hamas attacked their bus. It was not immediately possible to verify the competing claims or confirm the identities of those killed. The militia, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, said its fighters had attacked Hamas and killed five militants but made no mention of its own casualties. It also accused Hamas of detaining and killing aid workers. The deaths were the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private contractor that Israel says will replace the U.N. in distributing food to Gaza’s more than 2 million people. The past two weeks, dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded in near daily shootings as they try to reach GHF centers, with witnesses saying Israeli troops nearby have repeatedly opened fire. On Wednesday, at least 13 people were killed and 170 wounded when Israeli forces fired toward a crowd of Palestinians near a GHF center in central Gaza, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The military said it fired warning shots overnight at a gathering that posed a threat, hundreds of meters (yards) from the aid site. Internet and phone lines, meanwhile, were down across Gaza, according to telecom provider Paltel and the Palestinian telecoms authority. They said a key line was severed during an Israeli operation and that the military would not allow technicians into the area to repair it. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said emergency services were cut off because of the outage, and civilians cannot call ambulances. It said most U.N. agencies and aid groups could not reach their staff on the ground. ‘They were aid workers’ Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza, making it difficult to confirm what happened in the killings early Wednesday near the southern city of Khan Younis.

The details are being investigated,” it said, using an acronym for the Israeli Defense Forces. The shooting did not appear to be related to a new Israeli- and U.S.-supported aid delivery network that rolled out last month and has been marred by controversy and violence. ‘Aren’t we human beings?’ Yousef Nofal, an eyewitness, said he saw many people motionless and bleeding on the ground after Israeli forces opened fire. “It was a massacre,” he said, adding that the soldiers continued firing on people as they fled from the area. Mohammed Abu Qeshfa said he heard a loud explosion followed by heavy gunfire and tank shelling. “I survived by a miracle,” he said. The dead and wounded were taken to the city’s Nasser Hospital, which confirmed the toll. Samaher Meqdad was at the hospital looking for her two brothers and a nephew who had been in the crowd. “We don’t want flour. We don’t want food. We don’t want anything,” she said. “Why did they fire at the young people? Why?

            "Will this strip of land bury dreams of a Palestinian state?. MAALE ADUMIM, West Bank — The sun-starched strip of sand and brush doesn’t look like much, but if you squint, you can almost glimpse the dreamscape of a future Palestinian capital.\n“These spare lands mean that we can build our parliament, we can build our future institutions,” Khalil Toufakji, a Palestinian expert on geography and settlement expansion, told NBC News earlier this month as he gestured across the controversial “East 1,” or E1, section of the occupied West Bank.\n“If Israel builds here, it means that everything is finished at the same time,” the 76-year-old expert on Israeli settlements said at an overlook in the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. “This means that Jerusalem is surrounded from everywhere. … It means that there is no Palestinian geographic continuity between the north and south.”\nThe almost 5 square miles of land may seem undesirable and the conflict around it theoretical, but both Israel and the Palestinians regard the area’s fate with the same sense of urgency.\nSo when Israeli authorities approved the development of 3,400 homes last week, ultranationalist lawmakers celebrated what they saw as the death knell for a nascent Palestinian state and an acceleration of plans for Israel to annex the whole of the West Bank.\nThe development “practically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people’s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,” Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.\n“Now they declare it clearly and they don’t need to hide it,” said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. “It doesn’t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: ‘This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.’”\nSince the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.\nBut Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.\nThe construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave’s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.\nAfter almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThose countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a “violation of international law” in a statement Friday. “We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,” it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel’s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.\nBut the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.\n“In the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,” said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. “But it’s diplomatic pushback that’s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.”\nBut for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.\n“The E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,” said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. “Now under Trump, they’re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance … enabled the Israeli government to approve it.”\nThe White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.\nUpon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.\nIn his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel’s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.\nSo far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 — a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created “an environment where it’s easier for this government,” because “they don’t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.”\nThe additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.\nEven as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.\nThe Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim’s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.\nOnce housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.\nSuch detours shouldn’t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.\n“Instead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,” he said. “Israel’s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.”\nYet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood — particularly with American blessings — will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.\n“Wording there, condemnations here — it doesn’t make any change,” he said. “It will not push Israel back in any way.”",
            "Here&#8217;s a look at why it is so hard to end the war in Gaza. Joseph Krauss, Associated Press\nJoseph Krauss, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nIsrael is on the brink of launching another major offensive, this time in famine-stricken Gaza City.\nThe international community, along with nearly all Palestinians and many Israelis, wanted the war to end a long time ago — and a ceasefire seemed possible as recently as last month. So why is the conflict set to become even bloodier, nearly two years after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack?\nWATCH: Another 5 journalists killed after Israel strikes Gaza’s largest hospital\nCritics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accuse him of prolonging the war for political reasons. Netanyahu blames Hamas, which still holds around 20 living hostages, and says criticism of Israel’s wartime conduct is only making the militant group more intransigent.\nU.S. President Donald Trump says he wants the war to end and the hostages to come home. But his envoy, Steve Witkoff, walked away from ceasefire talks last month, blaming Hamas, and the president has exerted no public pressure on Israel to change course since it ended a ceasefire in March that he helped broker. It’s unclear if the U.S. is pursuing a different strategy behind the scenes.\nHamas said last week that it accepted a ceasefire proposal that mediators described as being nearly identical to one Israel had approved. The U.S. and Israel have yet to respond publicly. It’s unclear if the allies, which have recently hinted at seeking a comprehensive deal, are working on something behind the scenes.\nHere’s a closer look at why the war continues with no end in sight.\nIsraelis have joined mass protests calling for a ceasefire that would bring the hostages back. They say the war continues because Netanyahu is trying to stay in power.\nNetanyahu’s governing coalition depends on far-right parties that want to continue the war until Hamas has been annihilated, facilitate the mass relocation of Palestinians to other countries, and rebuild Jewish settlements that Israel dismantled in 2005.\nREAD MORE: Netanyahu pushes forward with expanded Gaza City operation despite widespread opposition\nThey have threatened to bolt if Netanyahu ends the war short of total victory. Opposition parties say they will step in and preserve his government if he reaches a hostage deal, but that would still leave Netanyahu severely weakened ahead of elections next year.\nLosing office would leave the Israeli leader far more vulnerable to long-standing corruption charges and to public inquiries into the failures surrounding the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.\nNetanyahu denies any such motives. He says the war must continue until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated, and that any agreement leaving the militant group intact and armed would allow it to eventually rebuild and carry out another major attack.\nNetanyahu says the war could end tomorrow if Hamas releases the hostages and lays down its arms.\nBut he has also said Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza and facilitate what he calls the voluntary emigration of much of Gaza’s population.\nPalestinians and many others say that would amount to forced expulsion — and it’s a nonstarter for Hamas.\nThe militant group has said it is willing to release the remaining 50 hostages — less than half believed by Israel to be alive — in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. It has also said it would hand over power to other Palestinians.\nBut it has ruled out laying down its arms or going into exile.\nEven if Hamas were to agree to disarm, it would be difficult to verify. Other armed groups might soon replace Hamas at the vanguard of what many Palestinians — even opponents of Hamas — see as legitimate armed resistance to military occupation.\nThat’s what happened when the Palestine Liberation Organization, the leading militant group of its day, agreed to go into exile in Tunisia after Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Hamas burst onto the scene in Gaza at the start of a Palestinian uprising five years later.\nFrom Hamas’ perspective, giving up arms would leave Palestinians defenseless in the face of Israel’s ongoing military rule and expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state. In their eyes it would all but doom that national aspiration.\nIn June, Trump sealed a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after ordering Netanyahu — by phone and social media post — to call off a wave of airstrikes. The stunning intervention in an ongoing Israeli military operation was a powerful demonstration of the United States’ leverage over its close ally.\nThere has been no sign of that with the war in Gaza.\nTrump has demanded that Hamas release the hostages while exerting no public pressure on Israel to halt or even curtail its operations — as former U.S. President Joe Biden tried to do with limited success.\nBeyond providing billions of dollars worth of arms to Israel, the United States has shielded it from U.N. calls for a ceasefire, sanctioned international judges pursuing Israeli officials, cracked down on campus protests, and even threatened Canada with higher tariffs over its stance on the Mideast conflict.\nThe influence of other countries over Israel, including the more than 30 Western-aligned nations that have called for the war to end, pales in comparison.\nAny pullback in U.S. support would alarm Israelis and might force Netanyahu to make concessions leading to a ceasefire — but there’s no sign of that. And it’s unclear what further pressure could be brought to bear on Hamas in Gaza after nearly all of its top leaders and thousands of fighters have been killed in one of the deadliest and most destructive military onslaughts since World War II.\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters there might be a “conclusive ending” in Gaza in the next two to three weeks, without elaborating.\n“I think we’re doing a very good job,” he said. “But it does have to, it does have to end.”\nStand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

            "Israel enters first stage of planned assault on Gaza City. TEL AVIV — Israel entered the first stages of a planned assault on Gaza City on Wednesday after approving a plan to take it over that includes calling up 60,000 reservists for an expanded military operation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\"We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters Wednesday.\nHe added: \"We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.\"\nDefrin also said that to \"minimize harm to civilians,\" the IDF will be warning citizens to allow them to evacuate.\n\"We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it — with additional central aid distribution points,\" he said.\nThe U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition — and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.\nThe assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel’s military offensive and aid restrictions.\nIn a statement Wednesday night, the prime minister's office said that \"ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables — for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas — be shortened.\"\n\"The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,\" the statement added. \"Together we will win.\"\nHamas criticized the Israeli military's announcement and said in a statement that the Israeli government \"insists on continuing its brutal war against innocent civilians, escalating its criminal operations in Gaza City with the aim of destroying it, and displacing its residents in a full-fledged war crime.\"\nThe United Nations also denounced the military operations Wednesday. \"Israel’s reported decision to take full control of Gaza City and to forcibly displace its population will lead to mass killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure vital to the survival of the population,\" the U.N. human rights office for the Palestinian territories said in a statement.\nPresident Donald Trump supports Israel's efforts to disarm Hamas, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\"Israel has to make this decision and has to live with whatever decision they make. But President Trump is fully supportive of making sure that Hamas knows that from the U.S. perspective, they have to disarm, they have to give up and let all the hostages go,\" he said. \"Whether it takes 60 days or 60 minutes, that’s the ultimate end result.\"\nScores of people in Gaza have starved to death in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.\nIn addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated Israel's streets, with growing numbers demanding an end to the offensive in the enclave.\nHundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.\nIsrael also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.\nHuckabee said that recent announcements by European leaders recognizing a Palestinian state would be \"counterproductive.\"\n\"If they believe that, unilaterally, calling for a two-state a Palestinian state recognition immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it’s taking them further away,\" he said.\nCeasefire talks uncertain\nKatz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was olding a discussion Tuesday to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.\nThe announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off news that Hamas had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free the remaining hostages.\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.\n“The ball is now in Israel’s court,” Abdelatty said, adding: “We would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.”\nAsked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be “under immense pressure.”\nAsked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said “no” and did not provide further clarification.\n'There is no safe place'\nNew satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel’s advance, with the country’s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave’s south condemned by rights groups.\nImagery captured on Aug. 16 shows that sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on Aug. 9.\nMohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again — just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel’s offensive.\n“Thank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,” Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel’s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.\nThe family was able to live in their home for the past six months — but with Israel planning to take over Gaza City, they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza.\n“There is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,” Abu Sharia said. “My concern is to save the family’s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.”\n“Further displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.\n“With more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,” it said.\nIsrael launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.\nSince then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed.",
            "Five children in Gaza among those killed by Israeli strike while fetching water. At least nine people, including five children, have been killed in an Israeli strike while fetching water in al-Mawasi, an area of southern Gaza which Israel has designated as a safe zone, health officials said.\nA doctor from al-Nasser hospital shared a picture of the children’s bodies in the hospital, as well as a picture of water jugs left in a pool of blood at the site of the attack on Tuesday.\nThe attack came shortly after the Israel Defense Forces encouraged people to leave Gaza City for al-Mawasi, before Israel’s looming invasion of Gaza City. The Israeli military has sought to displace people from the city before its offensive and has promised that southern Gaza would be able to accommodate them, despite experts disagreeing with the suggestion.\n“We wish to remind you that in al-Mawasi, enhanced services will be provided with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X on Tuesday afternoon.\nIsrael continued to push ahead with its operation and began the mobilisation of tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday.\nAt least 60,000 reservists will be called up, with the service of an additional 20,000 to be extended as the Israeli military slowly ramps up its military activity in Gaza City, which it has described as the last stronghold of Hamas.\nIsrael has said that the operation, known as Gideon’s Chariots II, to take over Gaza City will involve five divisions from the country’s standing army and could extend into next year.\nAlready Israel has pushed into the western parts of Gaza City, levelling the once prosperous neighbourhood of Zeitoun and declaring the entire city a “dangerous combat zone” last week. It has intensified its strikes, claiming to have killed the spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, in a strike on an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday.\nThe Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 76 people across the Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours, Gaza health authorities said.\nOn Monday, the world’s leading association of genocide scholars said Israel’s actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of Gaza City and the forced displacement of about 1 million people could have devastating humanitarian consequences. The population of the city has swelled over the course of the last 23 months as it became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from the near 80% of Gaza that is under evacuation order.\nThe city is already gripped by famine created by Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza, which experts say will worsen even in the absence of a military operation. Thirteen people, including three children, died from malnutrition on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death over the last 23 months to 361 – the majority of whom have died since July.\nIsrael is seeking to forcibly displace Gaza City’s residents before its operation and has tried to entice Palestinians to southern Gaza, which already is packed with other displaced people.\nThe head of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said on Saturday that there is no safe way to conduct a mass evacuation of Gaza City and that no other part of Gaza had the capacity to absorb such mass displacement. Earlier in August, the UN human rights office spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan said that Palestinians in al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.\nMany residents of Gaza City have refused to leave, suspicious of what awaits them in southern Gaza after Israel has attacked so-called humanitarian zones in the past.\nThe Gaza City operation, pushed forward by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, faces stiff opposition at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched across the country in protest against the war, which they say is aimless and endangers the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza.\nIsraeli media has reported internal opposition between the country’s cabinet and the military chief of staff. According to Israeli media’s retelling of a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, the Israeli military chief urged the government to take a ceasefire deal instead of pressing on with the Gaza City operation, which he said could harm the lives of hostages in Gaza.\nHamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal two weeks prior that resembled an earlier US draft which Israel had approved in prior rounds of negotiations. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal, baffling mediators.\nIsrael’s planned military operation in Gaza City as well as its continued systematic starving of the territory’s population has prompted a wave of global condemnation.\nOn Tuesday, Belgium announced it would join a growing list of European countries in recognising Palestine as a state. It also announced it would ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate Hamas leaders, violent Israeli settlers and two far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata.\n“This is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said in a post on X. He added that the EU should suspend its trade pact with Israel to further pressure it.\nThe move further increases the growing international isolation of Israel as its war in Gaza and subsequent famine grinds on.\nAt least 63,633 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023.",

At least 21,000 children disabled in Gaza since war began, says UN committee\nAt least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October 2023, a United Nations committee said on Wednesday.\nAbout 40,500 children have suffered “new war-related injuries” in the nearly two years since the war began, with more than half of them left disabled, said the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nIt is coming up to 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all the Guardian’s Middle East coverage here.\nHere is a summary of the developments on today’s blog:\nAt least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October 2023, a United Nations committee said on Wednesday. About 40,500 children have suffered “new war-related injuries” in the nearly two years since the war began, with more than half of them left disabled, said the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nThe Israeli military moved deeper into Gaza City on Wednesday, with soldiers and tanks pushing into Sheikh Radwan, one of the urban centre’s largest and most crowded neighbourhoods. The military dropped grenades on three schools in the Sheikh Radwan area that had been used to shelter displaced Palestinians, setting tents ablaze, according to residents who spoke to Reuters, who said Palestinians had fled before the bombing.\nThe military also detonated armoured vehicles laden with explosives to destroy homes in Sheikh Radwan’s east and bombed a medical clinic, destroying two ambulances, according to witnesses that spoke to Reuters. The Israeli military said in a statement on Wednesday it would continue to operate against “terrorists organisations” in Gaza and to “remove any threat” posed to Israel.\nHospital officials told the Associated Press (AP) at least 24 people were killed in strikes overnight into Wednesday. Nasser hospital said it received 10 bodies, including one aid-seeker in Rafah and a child killed by a strike in southern Gaza. Al-Shifa hospital said the bodies of 14 people, including two children and four women, arrived on Wednesday. Additionally, the al-Quds hospital said it received another person killed by Israeli strikes.\nFive adults and one child have died from malnutrition over the past day, the Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday. Hospital officials and Gaza’s health ministry said on Wednesday that the death toll in the territory kept climbing, with people killed in airstrikes while trying to reach aid, or from hunger.\nSite Management Cluster,a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites, said on Wednesday that Palestinians in and near Gaza City were “reluctant to move due to the fear of not being able to return or exhaustion from repeated displacement”. It said families were trapped by the prohibitively high cost of moving, logistical hurdles and a lack of places to go. Since Israel declared Gaza City a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction – 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million the UN estimates are in Gaza City – have left their homes in the city as of Monday, most to flee south, it added.\nFrance has condemned an Israeli drone attack near UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and called for the security of the Unifil troops to be respected. The peacekeeping force known as Unifil described the Tuesday morning incident as “one of the most serious attacks on Unifil personnel and assets” since the cessation of hostilities in November that ended the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. No one was hurt in the attack. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.\nProtesters took to Israel’s streets for what they called a “day of disruption” on Wednesday, denouncing the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists for an offensive that has drawn global condemnation and fueled fears in Israel it could endanger hostages still held in Gaza. Protesters were also pictured on top of the National Library of Israel, Jerusalem, staging a demonstration and demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Israeli hostages and the resignation of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.\nEurope and the west’s double standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned, describing the response to Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century. In an interview with the Guardian before talks with UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Wednesday, the socialist leader also said he was pleased that other European nations were following Spain’s lead in recognising a Palestinian state, but accepted Europe’s response had been poor.\nThe commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) has warned that Gaza is “becoming the graveyard of international humanitarian law”. In an interview with El País, Philippe Lazzarini, said Unrwa had been “warning about the signs of famine and sounding the alarm bells for months” but that its warnings had “fallen on deaf ears”. Lazzarini added: “We have made the Geneva convention[s] almost irrelevant. What is happening and being accepted today in Gaza is not something that can be isolated; it will become the new norm for all future conflicts.”\nOpposition leaders in Israel condemned the torching of bins, cars and tyres in Jerusalem by anti-government protesters. Yair Lapid, the opposition leader, posted on X: “I condemn the torching of vehicles in Jerusalem, but I condemn much more a government that abandons hostages to their deaths in Gaza.”\nIsrael’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called on Wednesday for the annexation of swathes of the occupied West Bank after a series of governments signalled their intention to recognise a Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over Palestinian urban areas in the West Bank, swiftly condemned the Israeli minister’s annexation call.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) warned Israel on Wednesday that any annexation of the West Bank would constitute a red line for Abu Dhabi that would severely undermine the spirit of the Abraham accords that normalised relations between the two countries. The comments marked the UAE’s strongest criticism of Israel’s conduct since the start of the Gaza war in 2023.\nIsrael has launched a new spy satellite that defence officials described as a strategic cornerstone, saying it will strengthen their surveillance capacity across the Middle East in the years ahead. Defence minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that it was “also a message to all our enemies, wherever they may be – we are keeping an eye on you at all times and in all situations”.\nA group of demonstrators disrupted a major cycling race in Spain on Wednesday in a protest against one of the teams participating: Team Israel-Premier Tech. Protesters held banners and flew Palestinian flags at the start of the La Vuelta in Bilbao, Spain. A Spanish left wing party previously called for Team Israel-Premier Tech to be excluded from the race.\nYemen’s Houthis claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a missile launched at Israel, saying they fired two ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv in what they said was an initial response to Israeli attacks on Yemen. The Israeli military said on Wednesday it intercepted the missile launched from Yemen, as sirens were activated in Tel Aviv and several other areas across the country,\nFive adults and one child have died from malnutrition over the past day, says Gaza health ministry\nHospital officials and Gaza’s health ministry said on Wednesday that the death toll in the territory kept climbing, with people killed in airstrikes while trying to reach aid, or from hunger, reports the Associated Press (AP).\nThe ministry said 113 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday – more than half in Gaza City – over the past 24 hours.\nThe toll reported was a casualty count seen regularly in recent weeks and came a day after Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli commanders told reservists the offensive was entering what they hoped would be a “decisive stage” of the war.\nThe ministry reported on Wednesday that five adults and one child died from malnutrition over the past day, bringing the total toll to 367, including 131 children throughout the war.\nPart of the Hamas-run government but staffed by medical professionals, the ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says women and children make up around half of the dead. UN agencies and many independent experts consider the ministry’s figures to be the most reliable estimate of war casualties. Israel disputes them, but has not provided its own toll, reports the AP.\nPalestinians 'reluctant to move due to exhaustion from repeated displacement', says humanitarian group\nHospital officials told the Associated Press (AP) at least 24 people were killed in strikes overnight into Wednesday.\nNasser hospital said it received 10 bodies, including one aid-seeker in Rafah and a child killed by a strike in southern Gaza. Al-Shifa hospital said the bodies of 14 people, including two children and four women, arrived on Wednesday. Additionally, the al-Quds hospital said it received another person killed by Israeli strikes.\nThe AP reports that Israel says that Gaza City – the largest Palestinian city in either the besieged strip or the occupied West Bank – remains a Hamas stronghold above what military officials claim is a vast underground tunnel network, even after raids earlier in the war.\nIsrael has intensified air and ground assaults on the outskirts of Gaza City, particularly in western neighbourhoods where people are being driven to flee toward the coast, according to humanitarian groups that coordinate assistance for the displaced.\nSite Management Cluster, one such group, said on Wednesday that families were trapped by the prohibitively high cost of moving, logistical hurdles and a lack of places to go. “Palestinians are also reluctant to move due to the fear of not being able to return or exhaustion from repeated displacement,” it said.\nA group of demonstrators have disrupted a major cycling race in Spain in a protest against one of the teams participating: Team Israel-Premier Tech.\nProtesters held banners and flew Palestinian flags at the start of the La Vuelta in Bilbao, Spain, pictures show. It is not the first time the cycling race has been disrupted by a demonstration against Team Israel-Premier Tech. According to reports, it is the third incident of pro-Palestinian protesters directly disrupting La Vuelta, after protesters entered the road in front of Israel-Premier Tech during the team time trial.\nCycling Weekly reports that a Spanish left wing party previously called for Team Israel-Premier Tech to be excluded from the race. There were also disruptive actions at both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France this year, it added.\nIsraelis stage a 'day of disruption' as more strikes hit Gaza City\nProtesters took to Israel’s streets for what they called a “day of disruption” on Wednesday, denouncing the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists for an offensive that has drawn global condemnation and fueled fears in Israel it could endanger hostages still held in Gaza.\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), the demonstrations accuse prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet of failing to secure a ceasefire deal and instead intensifying an invasion that hospitals in Gaza say in its initial stages is already accelerating a rise in fatalities.\n“We have to take an extreme action so that someone will remember. There’s no such thing as a state abandoning its citizens,” Yael Kuperman, a protester near the Knesset told Israeli public broadcaster Kan.\nIsrael’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called on Wednesday for the annexation of swathes of the occupied West Bank after a series of governments signalled their intention to recognise a Palestinian state, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nBelgium on Tuesday became the latest western country to say it will recognise the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly this month, after similar announcements by Australia, Canada and France.\n“The time has come to apply Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,” Smotrich said, using the name Israel applies to the West Bank, which it has occupied since 1967. He said the move would “take the idea of dividing our tiny land and establishing a terrorist state at its centre off the agenda once and for all”.\nThe Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over Palestinian urban areas in the West Bank, swiftly condemned the Israeli minister’s annexation call.\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry said it “condemns in the strongest terms the statements and positions made by the extremist minister Smotrich, particularly with regard to his inflammatory calls to deepen settlement activity and annex the occupied West Bank”.\nSmotrich called for Israeli annexation of “all open areas” of the territory, saying “the supreme principle of applying sovereignty … is the slogan: maximum land with minimum [Palestinian] population”. He added that the settlements administration within the defence ministry had in recent months drawn up maps which would apply Israeli sovereignty to approximately 82% of the West Bank.\nFrance is leading a push to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly this month and revive a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.\nSmotrich described the upcoming meeting in New York as an attempt by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority “to harm the state of Israel”.\n“The application of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria is a preventive step against the political attack planned against us and against the attempts to endanger our existence and the future of our children,” he said.\nFrance condemns Israeli attack on peacekeepers in Lebanon\nFrance has condemned an Israeli drone attack near UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and called for the security of the Unifil troops to be respected.\n“The protection of the peacekeepers, as well as the security of United Nations personnel, equipment and premises must be ensured,” the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the UN force had “an essential role for the stability of Lebanon and the region”.\nNo one was hurt in the attack on Tuesday when Israeli drones dropped four grenades near UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon.\nAt least 21,000 children disabled in Gaza since war began, says UN committee\nAt least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October 2023, a United Nations committee said on Wednesday.\nAbout 40,500 children have suffered “new war-related injuries” in the nearly two years since the war began, with more than half of them left disabled, said the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nUAE official warns West Bank settlement plans 'red line' for Abu Dhabi\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) warned Israel on Wednesday that any annexation of the West Bank would constitute a red line for Abu Dhabi that would severely undermine the spirit of the Abraham accords that normalised relations between the two countries, reports Reuters.\n“From the very beginning, we viewed the accords as a way to enable our continued support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspiration for an independent state,” Lana Nusseibeh, assistant minister for political affairs and envoy of the minister of foreign affairs of the UAE, told Reuters. “That was our position in 2020, and it remains our position today.”\nThe comments marked the UAE’s strongest criticism of Israel’s conduct since the start of the Gaza war in 2023.\nThe Abraham accords, signed during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation.\nNusseibeh said:\nWe call on the Israeli government to suspend these plans. Extremists, of any kind, cannot be allowed to dictate the region’s trajectory. Peace requires courage, persistence, and a refusal to let violence define our choices.\nThose who have left Gaza City over the past few months have found dire conditions elsewhere in Gaza, reports the Associated Press (AP). Their arrival has crowded already overflowing tent camps and sent prices of basic goods up.\nIman El-Naya, from Khan Younis, fled Gaza City three months ago. El-Naya told the AP:\nThe beach is crowded. Everywhere is crowded. There’s no hygiene. It’s a struggle to get water and food.\nI go and stand in line for water. Getting bread is a struggle. Everything is even more expensive after the people from the north came here.\nShorouk Abu Eid, a pregnant woman from Gaza City, was displaced to Khan Younis four months ago, reports the AP. She said the arrival of more people from the north is creating an even more tragic situation:\nThere is no privacy, no peace of mind. Places I used to walk to in five or 10 minutes are taking me around an hour now because of the congestion. There’s barely 10 centimeters between tents.\nJamal Abu Reily lamented that the bathrooms are overflowing and that there’s so little room for new arrivals:\nHow are we going to all fit here? Where are they going to stay? In the sea?\nSince Israel declared Gaza City a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction – 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million the UN estimates are in Gaza City – have left their homes in the city as of Monday, most to flee south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites, reports the Associated Press (AP).\nA fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.\nAlkurdi, a project manager and consultant, told the AP that he can hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he’s sheltering as they “erase the area completely.”\nZeitoun was once Gaza City’s largest neighbourhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighboring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by the AP from early August and early September. The photos show that entire blocks that have been pummeled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots, says the news agency.\n“It’s not something partial like before. It’s 100%,” Alkurdi told the AP. “The house, I’m telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.”\nMany of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi’s home was completely destroyed, so he is now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He told the AP that he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.\nAmjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO network, left his home in the Rimal neighbourhood in the early days of the war and also returned there with his family in January. He, like Al Kurdi, said his family would probably leave Gaza City if their area receives an evacuation order. But leaving this time would be different, he said. “Gaza will be leveled and destroyed. Last time, I had my car. There was fuel. Everyone had his income, his money.”\nBack then, the cities of Rafah and Khan Younis still stood in southern Gaza. Now, after months of bombardment, “there is no Rafah. Almost no Khan Younis,” Shawa told the AP.",
            "Middle East crisis: Israeli military carries out raid in West Bank city of Nablus – as it happened. The Israeli military on Wednesday launched an operation involving dozens of soldiers and armoured vehicles in the old city of Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank, witnesses and Palestinian officials told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nThe Israeli military confirmed to AFP that it was conducting an operation, without specifying its purpose.\nThe raid began at about 3.00am (0.00am UK time), residents said, with soldiers storming several neighbourhoods of the old city, which has a population of about 30,000 people.\n“The assault on Nablus is merely a show of force with no justification,” Nablus governor Ghassan Daghlas told AFP.\nHe said the army had informed Palestinian authorities that the raid would continue until 4.00 pm (1.00pm UK time).\nOne witness, who declined to give his name, reported that soldiers had expelled an elderly couple from their home.\nSoldiers “are storming and searching houses and shops inside the old city, while some houses have been turned into military posts,” Ghassan Hamdan, head of the Palestinian Medical Relief organisation in Nablus, said.\nAFP footage showed Israeli forces and military vehicles deployed on the streets of the city.\nLocal sources said clashes broke out at the eastern entrance to the old city, where young people threw stones at Israeli soldiers, who responded with teargas and live ammunition.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent reported several injuries as a result, but none from gunfire.\nThe old city of Nablus has been the focus several major Israeli raids, including in 2022 and 2023 during large-scale operations targeting a local grouping of armed fighters, as well as in 2002 during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising.\nIn early June 2025, the Israeli army carried out an operation there in which at least two Palestinians were killed.\nIsraeli and US officials will meet in Washington on Wednesday to discuss post-war Gaza, even as Israel’s military calls the evacuation of Gaza City “inevitable” ahead of a military offensive and with no sign of a ceasefire in sight, AP reports. The meeting comes as outrage mounts over this week’s deadly Israeli strikes on a southern Gaza hospital that killed 20, including journalists and emergency responders.\nIsraeli tanks pushed into a new area on the edge of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and prompting residents to flee, witnesses told Reuters. Tanks late on Tuesday entered into the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood on the northern edge of Gaza City and shelled houses, wounding several people and forcing many others, who had been taken by surprise, to move deeper into Gaza’s largest city, residents said.\nChildren under 15 years old made up almost a third of outpatients treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last year, statistics published in The Lancet reveal. The figures were released by MSF in correspondence with the respected medical journal and come from six health facilities in Gaza supported by the international medical NGO. The facilities are predominantly in the south and centre of the devastated territory.\nIsrael’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday that there will be more information in the “next few days” on a strike on Nasser hospital in Gaza on Monday, that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. “We’re still looking into the details of that incident, and so that in the next few days we will have more information about that,” Danon told reporters.\nThe Israeli military has said the country will add two “humanitarian aid distribution centres” in the southern Gaza Strip to receive Palestinians it expects to relocate there when the military carries out its planned takeover of Gaza City, Reuters reports. It said in a statement that the work would be completed in coming days, replacing the centre in the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood and bringing the number of distribution centres to a total of five.\nThe Israeli military on Wednesday launched an operation involving dozens of soldiers and armoured vehicles in the old city of Nablus, in the northern occupied West Bank. The Israeli military confirmed to the agency that it was conducting an operation, without specifying its purpose.\nResidents of the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City have spoken of heavy Israeli bombardment overnight. It comes after defence minister Israel Katz vowed on Friday to destroy Gaza City if Hamas does not agree to end the war on Israel’s terms.\nIsraeli police said on Wednesday that security forces seized roughly 1.5 million shekels ($447,000) of “terror funds” during a raid in the occupied West Bank a day earlier. Israeli forces targeted a currency exchange in Ramallah on Tuesday, leaving dozens of Palestinians wounded, according to the Red Crescent.\nPope Leo made a “strong appeal” to the global community on Wednesday to end the nearly two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas, calling for a permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid.\nHamas on Tuesday rejected an Israeli statement saying a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed several journalists was aimed at a camera operated by the militant group, calling the accusation “baseless”. The Israeli military on Tuesday said its forces were targeting a camera operated by Hamas in two strikes that killed five journalists at a hospital a day earlier, triggering a wave of international condemnation. Monday’s strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis killed at least 20 people, including the five reporters who worked for Al Jazeera, the Associated Press and Reuters, among other outlets.\nHamas denied on Tuesday that any of the Palestinians killed in Israel’s attack on Gaza’s Nasser hospital on Monday were militants. Earlier, Israel said it had killed six militants in the attack but it was investigating how civilians, including five journalists, were killed. “We can confirm that the Reuters and AP journalists were not a target of the strike,” military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told Reuters on Tuesday.\nThe UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, yield results and ensure accountability. “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN’s human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.\nTens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations across Israel on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and calling off plans to attack Gaza City. Relatives of hostages led the biggest march and rally in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered outside the prime minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the war. There were dozens of other protests around the country, including on the main highway to the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport.\nLebanese state media said US envoy Tom Barrack cut short a visit to the south on Wednesday amid protests in two planned stops against US pressure to disarm Hezbollah, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

The comments came after the trio of countries met with Iran on Tuesday to try to revive diplomacy over its nuclear programme.\nEight Syrian soldiers were killed in Israeli drone strikes in the Damascus countryside, state-run El Ekhbariya TV reported early on Wednesday. Syria and Israel are engaged in US-mediated talks on easing tensions in southern Syria, with Damascus seeking a security deal that could open the door to wider political negotiations.\nTen Palestinians have died from starvation in last 24 hours, says Gaza health ministry\nWilliam Christou\nTen Palestinians including two children have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, the health authorities in Gaza said on Wednesday, as Pope Leo XIV demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the population in the besieged territory.\nAt least 313 people have died from hunger, including 119 children, since the war in Gaza began and Israel intensified its siege on the Palestinian territory. Last week a UN-backed monitoring body confirmed that Gaza is in the throes of famine, warning that without more aid increasing numbers of people would lose access to food.\nAs humanitarian conditions continue to worsen the pope called for a suspension of hostilities.\n“I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected,” Leo said. He referred to international law and its “prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of the population”.\nIsraeli and US officials will meet in Washington on Wednesday to discuss post-war Gaza, even as Israel’s military calls the evacuation of Gaza City “inevitable” ahead of a military offensive and with no sign of a ceasefire in sight, AP reports.\nThe meeting comes as outrage mounts over this week’s deadly Israeli strikes on a southern Gaza hospital that killed 20, including journalists and emergency responders.\nIsrael’s military has said it will investigate the attack. It has offered no immediate explanation for striking twice and no evidence for an assertion that six of the dead were militants.\nAs a growing chorus of international leaders urge Israel to reconsider its offensive and commit to talks, Pope Leo XIV called for Israel to halt the “collective punishment” and forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza.\nA third of outpatients treated for wounds at MSF’s Gaza hospitals in 2024 were children, figures show\nJason Burke\nChildren under 15 years old made up almost a third of outpatients treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last year, statistics published in The Lancet reveal.\nThe figures were released by MSF in correspondence with the respected medical journal and come from six health facilities in Gaza supported by the international medical NGO. The facilities are predominantly in the south and centre of the devastated territory.\nMore than 90,000 outpatient consultations involving wounds were carried out at the facilities in 2024. Bombs, shelling or shooting was involved in just under half of these, MSF said.\nThe death toll in the Israeli offensive launched following the Hamas raid into Israel in October 2023 has risen to more than 62,000, according to a count by the ministry of health in Gaza that is used by much of the UN, and which the British government says is a “reasonable figure”. Of these, more than half are women or children.\nThe proportion could be higher. Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database indicate five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians, the Guardian revealed last week.\nIsraeli officials say they take all “feasible” precautions to avoid civilian casualties and accuse Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\nIsrael’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday that there will be more information in the “next few days” on a strike on Nasser hospital in Gaza on Monday, that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists.\n“We’re still looking into the details of that incident, and so that in the next few days we will have more information about that,” Danon told reporters.\n“Our goal is to fight terrorists, not journalists, not anyone who is not involved in terrorism,” he said.\nIsraeli military: Two new 'humanitarian aid distribution centres' to open in southern Gaza Strip\nThe Israeli military has said the country will add two “humanitarian aid distribution centres” in the southern Gaza Strip to receive Palestinians it expects to relocate there when the military carries out its planned takeover of Gaza City, Reuters reports.\nIt said in a statement that the work would be completed in coming days, replacing the centre in the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood and bringing the number of distribution centres to a total of five.\nThe Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday 10 more people had died of malnutrition and starvation, raising deaths from such causes to 313 people, including 119 children, since the Gaza war started nearly two years ago.

It called the attack “a grave violation of international law” and “clear breach of (Syria’s) sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\nThe statement said:\nIt also comes in the context of the repeated aggressive policies pursued by the Israeli occupation aimed at undermining security and stability in the region.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes.\nSince the fall of Bashar Assad in December, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on different parts of the country, destroying Syrian army assets, and its forces have seized a UN patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria.\nPope Leo XIV says Israel must stop 'collective punishment' of Palestinian people in Gaza\nIn an update to earlier comments by Pope Leo XIV, he said that Israel must stop the “collective punishment” and forced displacement of Palestinian people in Gaza as he pleaded for an immediate and permanent ceasefire amid preparations by Israel for a new military offensive.\nLeo was interrupted twice by applause as he read aloud his latest appeal for an end to the 22-month war during his weekly general audience attended by thousands of people in the Vatican’s auditorium.\nHistory’s first American pope also called for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in southern Israel – 50 of them remain in Gaza – and for both sides and international powers to end the war “which has caused so much terror, destruction and death”.\n“I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected,” Leo said. He cited international law requiring the obligation to protect civilians and “the prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of the population”.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that president Donald Trump would chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel’s war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year.

            "Israel expands Gaza City offensive as UK decries West Bank settlement approval. Israel has announced it is expanding its military operations in Gaza City, as the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned its approval of a huge new illegal settlement in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law.”\nThe Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said the IDF had begun the second phase of Operation Gideon’s Chariots in Gaza, which it launched in May.\nHe said the IDF would intensify efforts to harm Hamas in Gaza City, which he deemed a “stronghold of regime and military terror”, as part of the operation.\nDefrin’s briefing coincided with a statement from Benjamin Netanyahu’s office in which he called for the acceleration of a much-threatened offensive to conquer Gaza City, an urban area home to hundreds of thousands of people in the north of the territory.\n“Ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables – for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas – be shortened,” the statement said.\nIt was unclear if Defrin’s statement was referring to the wider operation, plans for which have drawn widespread international condemnation.\nHamas said that Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n“Today’s announcement by the terrorist occupation army of the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly one million residents and displaced persons … demonstrates … a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators,” it said in a statement.\nIsraeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on Hamas in ongoing negotiations over a ceasefire and an end to the war.\nDefrin said Israeli forces were already occupying the outskirts of Gaza City and were operating in the Zeitoun neighbourhood.\nIsrael had announced earlier on Wednesday that it was calling up an extra 60,000 reservists for the Gaza City offensive. It justified launching a new phase by citing an attack by about 18 Hamas fighters on an Israeli position the day before, which it had characterised as large-scale, despite its small size in reality.\nThousands of Palestinians, facing widening conditions of starvation in Gaza, had already begun to flee in recent days in anticipation of the assault.\nJordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said on Wednesday that Israel’s assault on Gaza had caused “massacres and starvation” and that its wider actions were “killing all prospects” for peace in the Middle East.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, echoed the sentiment, saying the proposed offensive would lead to “true disaster” and drag the region into permanent war.\nGermany said it found it “increasingly difficult to understand how these actions will lead to the freeing of all the hostages, or to a ceasefire”, the government spokesperson Steffen Meyer told reporters.\nThe Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, announced that he had approved a plan to conquer Gaza City despite the decision earlier this week by Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza to accept a ceasefire proposal that in most of its most significant details aligns with one Israel had previously agreed. It has yet to formally respond to the latest proposal.\nIsrael also announced on Wednesday that plans to build a major new illegal settlement block in the West Bank had been approved. The block would split the West Bank into two with the deliberate intention – according to Israel’s far-right finance minster, Bezalel Smotrich – of killing off any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nLammy wrote on X that if implemented the plan “would divide a Palestinian state in two, mark a flagrant breach of international law and critically undermine the two-state solution”.\nIsrael’s top planning committee approved plans for the E1 settlement in an area of land east of Jerusalem that critics have said would undermine hopes for a contiguous Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nSmotrich backed plans last week to build 3,400 homes on a contentious parcel of land that lies between Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim.\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, said building Israeli homes there would put an end to hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAmid credible evidence that its policies in Gaza have led to conditions of mass starvation and accusations of genocide, Israel has reiterated its defiance of outraged international opinion that is threatening to turn it into a pariah state, even as a growing number of countries have said they plan to recognise Palestinian statehood.\nThe call-up of 60,000 reservists and extension of the service for another 20,000 soldiers took place days after hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied to call for a ceasefire.\nA growing campaign of exhausted reservists has accused the government of perpetuating the war for political reasons and failing to bring home the remaining hostages.\nThe families of the hostages and former army and intelligence chiefs have also expressed opposition to the expanded operation in Gaza City. Most of the families want an immediate ceasefire and worry an expanded assault could imperil efforts to bring home the 50 hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes that 20 are still alive.\nA military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said troops would operate in parts of Gaza City where they have not yet been deployed and where Israel believes Hamas is still active.\nGaza City is Hamas’s military and governing stronghold and one of the last places of refuge in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering. Israeli troops would target Hamas’s vast underground tunnel network there, the official said.\nIt remains unclear when the operation will begin, but it could be a matter of days. The mobilisation of reservists is the largest in months.",
            "Netanyahu defends Gaza plans as Israel heavily criticised at UN Security Council. Netanyahu defends Gaza plans as Israel heavily criticised at UN Security Council\nUN ambassadors have condemned Israel's plans to \"take control\" of Gaza City as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted it was the \"best way\" to end the war.\nDuring a press conference, which Netanyahu said was intended to \"puncture the lies\", the Israeli leader said the planned offensive would move \"fairly quickly\" and would \"free Gaza from Hamas\".\nHe also claimed Israeli hostages held in Gaza were \"the only ones being deliberately starved\" and denied Israel was starving Gazans.\nMeanwhile, Israel came under heavy criticism at an emergency meeting of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, with the UK, France and others warning the plan risked \"violating international humanitarian law\".\nAlong with Denmark, Greece and Slovenia, they called for the plan to be reversed, adding it would \"do nothing to secure the return of hostages and risks further endangering their lives\".\nOther council members expressed similar alarm. China called the \"collective punishment\" of people in Gaza unacceptable, while Russia warned against a \"reckless intensification of hostilities\".\nUN Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenca told the meeting: \"If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction.\"\nRamesh Rajasingham from the UN's humanitarian office said the hunger crisis in Gaza was no longer looming, adding that \"this is starvation, pure and simple\".\nBut the United States defended Israel, with Ambassador Dorothy Shea telling the meeting the US had been working \"tirelessly\" to free hostages and end the war, and the meeting undermined those efforts.\nShe added the war \"could end today if Hamas let the hostages go\", and accused other members of taking advantage of the meeting to \"accuse Israel of genocide\", an allegation she insisted was \"demonstrably false\".\nLater on Sunday, Netanyahu's office said he had spoken with US President Donald Trump about Israel's plans.\nThousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across Israel to oppose the government's plan, fearing it puts the lives of hostages at risk.\nIn his press conference, Netanyahu said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had been instructed to dismantle the \"two remaining Hamas strongholds\" in Gaza City and a central area around al-Mawasi.\nHe also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid in Gaza, including designating safe corridors for humanitarian aid distribution as well as more air drops by Israeli forces and other partners.\nHe said the plan would also include increasing the number of safe distribution points managed by the controversial US and Israeli-backed Gazan Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nThe UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians had been killed seeking food since late May, when GHF set up aid distribution sites.\nNetanyahu claimed Hamas had \"violently looted the aid trucks\", and, when asked about Palestinians killed at GHF sites, said \"a lot of firing was done by Hamas\".\nWhen asked about the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza - 20 of whom are still thought to be alive - Netanyahu said \"if we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out\".\nThe Israeli leader also took aim at the international press, saying it had bought into Hamas propaganda. He labelled some of the photos of malnourished children in Gaza that have run on newspaper front pages across the world as \"fake\".\nThroughout the war, Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza to report freely. But Netanyahu said a directive telling the military to bring in foreign journalists had been in place for two days.\nSince Saturday, five people have died as a result of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, bringing the total number to 217 deaths, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIt also said that in total more than 61,000 people have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign since 2023.\nIsrael launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October that year, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nIn the past, figures from the Hamas-run health ministry were widely used in times of conflict and seen as reliable by the UN and other international organisations.",
            "Following Trump’s lead, Netanyahu shifts strategy on ceasefire even after Hamas accepts | CNN. Nearly a week after Hamas accepted the latest Gaza ceasefire proposal from Qatari and Egyptian mediators, Israel has yet to respond - even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims he is “immediately” starting negotiations to release all the hostages and end the war.\nThe silence reflects a fundamental shift in Israel’s approach that has befuddled mediators and families of the remaining hostages, who have accused Netanyahu of abandoning and sacrificing their loved ones.\nAfter 18 months of agreeing only to partial, phased ceasefire deals, Netanyahu is now demanding a comprehensive agreement that would secure the release of all hostages and end the war entirely – on Israel’s terms. The policy reversal comes as the prime minister simultaneously accelerates plans for a massive military assault on Gaza City, pursuing a dual strategy of negotiating while waging war to “defeat Hamas.”\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu declared that he had instructed his team to immediately start negotiations for the return of all the hostages and end the war in Gaza. But he did so without once mentioning the proposal currently on the table – which calls for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the hostages. The latest proposal is similar to the 60-day ceasefire Netanyahu agreed to last month, only with terms more favorable to Israel after Hamas showed flexibility on the number of prisoners to be released and the size of the security perimeter.\nAt the same time, Netanyahu made a point of continuing to advance plans for the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) massive assault and takeover of Gaza City. Israel attributes Hamas’ concessions to the threat of its imminent Gaza City offensive, and Israeli officials say they believe the renewed threat of heavy military pressure will make Hamas more flexible to accept Israel’s conditions to end the war.\nIsrael has long claimed that military pressure will force Hamas to the table, but the terror group, while depleted, has defied defeat despite nearly two years of fighting.\nNetanyahu has not explained what caused this dramatic shift from a partial to a comprehensive negotiation framework, and his mixed messaging has left many in Israel and abroad confused: for a year and a half the government refused to discuss ending the war and only agreed to negotiate phased and partial ceasefire agreements. Now he’s opting only for a comprehensive deal and has been reluctant to respond to the mediators’ latest proposal that was accepted by Hamas,\nBasem Naim, a senior member of Hamas’ political bureau, said in a statement, “The movement has presented everything necessary to reach a ceasefire agreement and is still ready to do so with all national responsibility and an open mind.” Naim said that Netanyahu has a “green light” from the Trump administration to continue what he called a “dirty game.”\nTrump’s belief that Hamas ‘want to die’\nAccording to senior Israeli sources, the answer in Netanyahu’s new negotiations strategy lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has expressed explicit public support for Israel’s renewed assault in Gaza, adopting the Israeli rhetoric aiming to destroy Hamas, instead of pushing for a temporary ceasefire.\n“We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be,” President Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform last week.\nAccording to one senior Israeli source, after Hamas raised obstacles during the last round of negotiations in Qatar in July, Trump “lost patience and trust with the partial process and doesn’t believe Hamas actually wants a deal.”\nThis echoes remarks his envoy Steve Witkoff made after the latest round of talks collapsed, slamming Hamas as uncoordinated and not acting in good faith and saying the US would explore alternative options to secure hostage release and stabilize Gaza.\n“It was too bad. Hamas didn’t really want to make a deal. I think they want to die,” Trump told reporters outside the White House at the time. Shortly after the comments, Netanyahu’s office shifted to an “all or nothing” approach, demanding a comprehensive deal.\nIn the latest Israeli security cabinet meeting, during which Netanyahu’s government approved the decision to expand and deepen the operation in Gaza City, five conditions were set to end the war: disarmament of Hamas, the release of all the hostages, demilitarization of Gaza while maintaining Israeli security control, and the establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\nBut Hamas has drawn a red line at any notion of disarming. Israeli analysts say Netanyahu’s double-messaging – pursuing war and peace – is a political tactic to buy time. It prolongs the war and his own rule.\n“Netanyahu is fully aware that Hamas will never accept his conditions for ending the war – and that is precisely his point,” Chaim Levinson, a senior diplomatic commentator for Israel’s Haaretz newspaper, told CNN. Netanyahu’s demand for territorial control over large swaths of Gaza “is likely to derail any potential agreement.”\nNetanyahu has demanded full Israeli security control over Gaza in any post-war scenario, a scenario in which Israel would retain the right to carry out strikes in Gaza. “Under such conditions, no one will invest in Gaza, since the territory would remain trapped in a state of ongoing conflict,” Levinson said.\nWhile repeated polling has shown that the vast majority of the Israeli public would support any deal that would bring back the hostages - Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, adamantly oppose any ceasefire or end to the war, and have warned more than once that it could lead to the collapse of his government.\nBecause of that overt threat, all of the hostage deals so far were designed as phased and gradual, according to an Israeli source with knowledge of the negotiations. The partial approach enabled Netanyahu to promise his coalition partners that Israel will resume the war eventually.\nNetanyahu’s far-right allies have pressed the Israeli leader to expand the war and ramp up the bombardment of the devastated enclave until Hamas surrenders.\nFormer State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the Biden administration believed Netanyahu was throwing up roadblocks to a ceasefire deal. “There were times that we very much wanted to go public and make clear that we thought the prime minister was being completely intransigent and making it tougher to get a deal,” he told Israel’s Channel 13. But the administration kept the disagreements private, Miller said, because former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar pulled back from negotiations when he saw a split between the US and Israel.\nThe prime minister’s latest maneuvering and perceived double messaging has escalated tensions between his government and the families of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The families, who have been ramping up public pressure since the cabinet approved the Gaza City offensive, accused the government of sacrificing the hostages by delaying or dismissing the partial agreement on the table.\nAfter launching some of the largest anti-war protests Israel has seen since the beginning of the conflict nearly two years ago, the hostage families are scheduling another protest for Tuesday night, trying to keep the pressure on a government they feel is deaf to their cries of pain.\nEinav Zangauker, the mother of Matan, who is held hostage in Gaza, blamed Netanyahu for torpedoing the negotiations. “You are setting unattainable conditions to end the war, preparing the army to conquer Gaza, you will lead soldiers into death traps,” she said at a demonstration on Friday night outside the prime minister’s residence. “You will sentence Matan to death, you will cause the deceased hostages to disappear forever!”\nIn an attempt to brush off public criticism, Netanyahu’s office briefed Israeli reporters over the weekend that he will be sending a negotiation team as soon as a location is set for the talks.\nBut without a site selected for the next attempt at ceasefire negotiations – and with the US team tied up with Ukraine and Russia – Netanyahu can pursue his dual strategy: making statements about ending the war while taking military action that escalates it.",

            "Israeli military urges full evacuation of Gaza City ahead of expanded military operation. By WAFAA SHURAFA, SAMY MAGDY, and MELANIE LIDMAN Associated Press\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military urged a full evacuation of Gaza City on Tuesday morning ahead of its planned expanded offensive in the northern city, where hundreds of thousands of people struggle under conditions of famine.\nIt was the first warning for a full evacuation of the city in the current round of fighting. Previously, the military has warned specific sections of Gaza City to evacuate ahead of concentrated operations or strikes.\nAssociated Press reporters saw more cars and trucks than previous days passing from northern to southern Gaza on Tuesday, laden with supplies and people, but no widespread evacuation.\nIsrael says multiple towers destroyed in Gaza City\nIsrael said it has demolished 50 high-rise buildings in Gaza in the past two days, which it accused Hamas of using for military infrastructure. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the demolition of the high-rises “only the introduction, only the beginning of the main intensive operation — the ground incursion of our forces.”\nFirst responders rescued two survivors and extricated two bodies from one of the demolished buildings on Tuesday afternoon, according to the civil defense, part of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry.\nThe civil defense said others remain trapped under the rubble and that rescuers had been unable to reach them due to lack of equipment.\nThe demolitions are part of Israel ramping up its offensive to take control of what it portrays as Hamas’ last remaining stronghold, urging Palestinians to flee parts of Gaza City for a designated humanitarian zone in the territory’s south.\nDespite warnings, few Palestinians have left\nTuesday’s warnings were the most widespread evacuation warnings in the current round of fighting. Israel’s previous warnings to leave specific neighborhoods have had little impact on a population that is exhausted from multiple displacements and unclear if moving to southern Gaza will really be safer.\nThere are an estimated 1 million Palestinians in the area of north Gaza around Gaza City, according to both the Israeli military and the United Nations, around half of Gaza’s population of 2.1 million. As of Sept. 7, a coalition of humanitarian groups tracking movement in northern Gaza said they had tracked 50,000 movements of people fleeing south. A similar number were people moved within northern Gaza.\nThe data from the coalition, called the Site Management Cluster, tracks movement from eyewitness accounts, social media posts and information from partners on the ground, because access to northern Gaza is heavily restricted.\nMilitary spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee warned last week that the full evacuation of Gaza City was “inevitable,” saying families who move south would receive humanitarian assistance. But aid groups warned there was little infrastructure to support them.\nPalestinians and hostage survivors protest Israeli operation\nDozens of Palestinians, including doctors and medical staff, took part in a protest in Gaza City on Tuesday that rejected the Israeli warnings.\n“We will never leave our land … health care workers won’t leave and we are calling for protection,” said Dr. Muneer al-Boursh, the general director of Gaza’s Health Ministry.\nDr. Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, said although the situation in Gaza City was tense, the facility was still open.\n“So far, things are as usual,” he told the AP after the evacuation warning. “But the atmosphere is tense and there is great psychological pressure on the staff and patients.”\nHe said he didn’t notice displacement in and around the hospital.\nIn Jerusalem, families of hostages and former captives in Gaza pleaded with Israeli lawmakers to halt the Gaza City offensive.\n“I was held captive by Hamas for 498 days and was released in a deal in February,” Iair Horn, whose brother, Eitan, is still in captivity, told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. “If I was released through a deal, then apparently that’s the right way to free the rest of the hostages who remain.”\nUN says it costs at least $1000 to evacuate to southern Gaza\nThe United Nations humanitarian agency said many families can’t evacuate even if they want to, because displacement sites are overcrowded and because it can cost more than $1,000 in transportation and other costs to move to southern Gaza, a prohibitive amount for many.\nA U.N. initiative to bring temporary shelters into Gaza said that more than 86,000 tents and other supplies were still awaiting clearance to enter Gaza as of last week.\nThe U.N. agency that oversees Palestinian refugees said Tuesday said that Israeli attacks on residential towers in Gaza City had displaced dozens of families, with many of them having been left “on the streets without shelter or basic necessities.”\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid to Gaza said 1,500 humanitarian aid trucks primarily containing food entered Gaza last week, and there are plans to bring in 100,000 tents in the coming weeks, many of which are currently waiting in Jordan. The tents needed to be adapted to swap metal poles, which COGAT said were repurposed into rockets used by militants, with plastic poles.\nThe war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people on Oct. 7, 2023, and killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Forty-eight hostages are still inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed to be alive.\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,522 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says around half of those killed were women and children. Large parts of major cities have been completely destroyed and around 90% of the population of some 2 million Palestinians have been displaced.\n2 Palestinian teenagers killed in the West Bank\nTwo 14-year-old Palestinian boys were killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian Health Ministry.\nThe Israeli military said the incident happened in the northern West Bank City of Jenin, where several people approached Israeli soldiers in a way that “posed a threat.” The area was under military closure and entry was prohibited at the time, the military said, without providing further information.\nAhmad Majarmeh, a resident of Jenin, said Israeli soldiers started shooting “randomly” at a group of people had come to collect belongings from their homes, which they were forced to leave months ago. Majarmeh said his nephew, Islam Majarmeh, was one of two people caught at the back of the group who was killed from gunfire.\nAlso in the West Bank, an Israeli investigation continued into two Palestinians who opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem on Monday, killing six people. It was the deadliest attack against civilians in Israel in nearly a year.\nHamas claimed responsibility for the attack, though Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service said the two attackers had no known militant ties and no prior arrests.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday he placed sanctions on the relatives and residents of the towns where the two attackers are from, will order all buildings constructed without permits to be demolished, and canceled 750 work visas for town residents.\n__\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the demolition of the high-rises “only the introduction, only the beginning of the main intensive operation — the ground incursion of our forces.”\nFirst responders rescued two survivors and extricated two bodies from one of the demolished buildings on Tuesday afternoon, according to the civil defense, part of the Hamas-run Interior Ministry.\nThe civil defense said others remain trapped under the rubble and that rescuers had been unable to reach them due to lack of equipment.\nThe demolitions are part of Israel ramping up its offensive to take control of what it portrays as Hamas’ last remaining stronghold, urging Palestinians to flee parts of Gaza City for a designated humanitarian zone in the territory’s south.\nTuesday’s warnings were the most widespread evacuation warnings in the current round of fighting. Israel’s previous warnings to leave specific neighborhoods have had little impact on a population that is exhausted from multiple displacements and unclear if moving to southern Gaza will really be safer.\nA Palestinian man holds a leaflet, dropped by Israeli forces, ordering residents of Gaza City to evacuate, in Gaza City Sept. 9, 2025. Photo by Dawoud Abu Alkas/ Reuters\nThere are an estimated 1 million Palestinians in the area of north Gaza around Gaza City, according to both the Israeli military and the United Nations, around half of Gaza’s population of 2.1 million. As of Sept. 7, a coalition of humanitarian groups tracking movement in northern Gaza said they had tracked 50,000 movements of people fleeing south. A similar number were people moved within northern Gaza.\nThe data from the coalition, called the Site Management Cluster, tracks movement from eyewitness accounts, social media posts and information from partners on the ground, because access to northern Gaza is heavily restricted.\nMilitary spokesperson Col. Avichay Adraee warned last week that the full evacuation of Gaza City was “inevitable,” saying families who move south would receive humanitarian assistance. But aid groups warned there was little infrastructure to support them.\nDozens of Palestinians, including doctors and medical staff, took part in a protest in Gaza City on Tuesday that rejected the Israeli warnings.\n“We will never leave our land … health care workers won’t leave and we are calling for protection,” said Dr. Muneer al-Boursh, the general director of Gaza’s Health Ministry.\nREAD MORE: With Israeli advance looming, Palestinians in Gaza City ask when to leave and where to go\nDr. Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, said although the situation in Gaza City was tense, the facility was still open.\n“So far, things are as usual,” he told the AP after the evacuation warning. “But the atmosphere is tense and there is great psychological pressure on the staff and patients.”\nHe said he didn’t notice displacement in and around the hospital.\nIn Jerusalem, families of hostages and former captives in Gaza pleaded with Israeli lawmakers to halt the Gaza City offensive.\n“I was held captive by Hamas for 498 days and was released in a deal in February,” Iair Horn, whose brother, Eitan, is still in captivity, told the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense\nCommittee. “If I was released through a deal, then apparently that’s the right way to free the rest of the hostages who remain.”\nThe United Nations humanitarian agency said many families can’t evacuate even if they want to, because displacement sites are overcrowded and because it can cost more than $1,000 in transportation and other costs to move to southern Gaza, a prohibitive amount for many.\nA U.N. initiative to bring temporary shelters into Gaza said that more than 86,000 tents and other supplies were still awaiting clearance to enter Gaza as of last week.\nThe U.N. agency that oversees Palestinian refugees said Tuesday said that Israeli attacks on residential towers in Gaza City had displaced dozens of families, with many of them having been left “on the streets without shelter or basic necessities.”\nDisplaced Palestinians flee amid an Israeli military operation, following an Israeli evacuation order, in Gaza City, Sept. 9, 2025.

The tents needed to be adapted to swap metal poles, which COGAT said were repurposed into rockets used by militants, with plastic poles.\nThe war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people on Oct. 7, 2023, and killed some 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians. Forty-eight hostages are still inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed to be alive.\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,522 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says around half of those killed were women and children. Large parts of major cities have been completely destroyed and around 90% of the population of some 2 million Palestinians have been displaced.\nTwo 14-year-old Palestinian boys were killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian Health Ministry.\nREAD MORE: Israel steps up Gaza City attacks while Houthi drone strikes an Israeli airport in rare hit\nThe Israeli military said the incident happened in the northern West Bank City of Jenin, where several people approached Israeli soldiers in a way that “posed a threat.” The area was under military closure and entry was prohibited at the time, the military said, without providing further information.\nAhmad Majarmeh, a resident of Jenin, said Israeli soldiers started shooting “randomly” at a group of people had come to collect belongings from their homes, which they were forced to leave months ago. Majarmeh said his nephew, Islam Majarmeh, was one of two people caught at the back of the group who was killed from gunfire.\nAlso in the West Bank, an Israeli investigation continued into two Palestinians who opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem on Monday, killing six people. It was the deadliest attack against civilians in Israel in nearly a year.\nHamas claimed responsibility for the attack, though Israel’s Shin Bet internal security service said the two attackers had no known militant ties and no prior arrests.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday he placed sanctions on the relatives and residents of the towns where the two attackers are from, will order all buildings constructed without permits to be demolished, and canceled 750 work visas for town residents.\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Lidman from Tel Aviv, Israel.

            "U.S. Senate GOP will try to drag Trump’s mega-bill across the finish line. 14:58\nrepublished\nU.S. Senate GOP will try to drag Trump’s mega-bill across the finish line\nCassidy says some House GOP health care provisions might not make it through\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., left, listens as Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, center, speaks to reporters outside of the West Wing of the White House on June4, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republican Leader John Thune will spend a crucial next few weeks working behind the scenes with other top GOP senators to reshape the party’s “big beautiful bill” — a balancing test accompanied in recent days by incendiary exchanges between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk over whether the current proposals are so bad that Congress should just go back to the drawing board.\nSouth Dakota’s Thune will need to gain support from deficit hawks, who want to see the mega-bill cut at least $2 trillion in spending, and moderates, who are closely monitoring how less federal funding for safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance could harm their constituents and home-state institutions like rural hospitals.\nInterviews by States Newsroom with Republican senators in early June showed many major elements of the package could change, including provisions that would put states on the hook for unanticipated costs. Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, for example, indicated the Senate may rewrite a proposal in the House-passed bill that would shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid to low-income people, to state governments.\n“We can do whatever we want to do,” the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee chairman said when asked by States Newsroom about amending that policy.\nThe final deal — intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts — cannot lose more than three GOP senators and still make it back across the Capitol to the House for final approval, since all Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Thune only needs a majority vote in the Senate for the special process being used by Republicans.\nInternal debates about just how to rework the Trump-backed tax and spending cuts measure began in the first week of June during meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House, as GOP senators began critiquing the House-passed package line-by-line to ensure it complies with their strict rules for the complex reconciliation process and their policy goals.\nRepublicans said during interviews that several provisions in the House version likely won’t comply with the chamber’s Byrd rule, which could force lawmakers to toss out some provisions.\nComplicating all of it was the very public back-and-forth between not just Trump but GOP leaders and former White House adviser Musk over the bill, which Musk on social media labeled “a disgusting abomination” and a “big, ugly spending bill” for its effect on the deficit and debt limit. “KILL the BILL,” Musk said on X, the platform he owns. Senate leaders so far have dismissed Musk’s criticisms.\nFragile House coalition\nThe talks, and whatever the legislation looks like after a marathon amendment voting session expected in late June, have already raised deep concerns among House GOP lawmakers, who will have to vote on the bill again in order to send it to Trump.\nThe extremely narrow majorities mean House Republican leaders cannot lose more than four of their own members if all the lawmakers in that chamber vote on the party-line bill.\nAny changes the Senate makes could unbalance the fragile coalition of votes Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cobbled together last month for a 215-214 vote. But GOP senators are adamant they will amend the legislation.\nComplicating matters is a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the proposed changes to tax law, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and higher education aid wouldn’t actually help to reduce deficits during the next decade but raise them by more than $2.4 trillion.\nThe numbers are the exact opposite for what Republicans hoped their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would accomplish.\nScrutiny begins\nThe first stop for the House-passed reconciliation package in the Senate appears to be the parliamentarian’s office, where staff have begun evaluating whether each provision in the current version of the bill complies with the upper chamber’s strict rules.\nBoozman said staff on his panel have already begun meeting with the parliamentarian to go over the House provisions within its jurisdiction.\nHe expects that section of the package will have to change to comply with the strict rules that govern the reconciliation process in the Senate and to better fit that chamber’s policy goals.\n“We can’t really decide exactly what we want to use in the House version until we know what’s eligible,” Boozman said. “We’ve got some other ideas too that we asked them about. But we need to know, of the ideas that we have, what would be viable options as far as being Byrd eligible.”\nThe Byrd rule, which is actually a law, requires reconciliation bills to address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit. This generally bars lawmakers from using the special budget process to change policies that don’t have a significant impact on those three areas.\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is campaigning to become his home state’s next governor, said pushing some of the cost of the nutrition program to states may be problematic.\n“We’re trying to send more costs to the states. Most states can’t afford that, so we want to take care of people, but we need people to go back to work,” Tuberville said. “It’s not a forever entitlement. It’s for part-time, you know, take care of yourself until you get a job, go back to work and let people that need it really, really get it.”\nRural hospitals on edge\nSenate GOP leaders will have to navigate how best to reduce federal spending on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some with disabilities, that is relied on by tens of millions of Americans, many of whom are loyal Republican voters.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid during the next decade if the House’s policy changes are implemented as written.\nThere are also concerns among GOP lawmakers about how losing the revenue that comes with treating Medicaid patients would impact rural health care access and hospitals.\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley said under no circumstances would he vote for a bill that cuts benefits to Medicaid recipients and is worried about how provisions in the House package would affect rural hospitals.\n“They’re very concerned about it, rightly so,” Hawley said, referring to conversations he’s had with health care systems in his home state.\n“This is something that we need to work on. I don’t know why we would penalize rural hospitals,” he added. “If you want to reduce health care spending, then cap the price of prescription drugs. I mean, that’s the way to do it. If you want to get major savings in the health care sector, don’t close rural hospitals, don’t take away benefits from working people. Cap the costs, cap the price that (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) is going to pay for prescription drugs.”\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she’s not yet come to a decision about whether to keep, amend, or completely scrap some of the House changes to Medicaid.\n“I talked to a lot of our hospitals when I was home to see what the impacts would be, because we have a very high Medicaid population,” Capito said. “I want to see it work and be preserved, but I want it to be there for future generations. And it’s just getting way out of control on the spend side. So right now, we’re looking at everything.”\nLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy — chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — said he doesn’t expect all of the health care provisions in the House bill make it through the “Byrd bath” with the parliamentarian. But he declined to go into detail.\n“Some of it is more regulatory, that’s all I can say,” Cassidy said.\nWest Virginia’s Sen. Jim Justice said he is in favor of requiring some Medicaid enrollees to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to stay on the program, a sentiment shared by many of his GOP colleagues.\n“I’m good with every bit of that,” he said.\nBut Justice expects the Senate will make its own changes to the package and that it will be “proud of their own pond.”\n“Any frog that’s not proud of your own pond’s not much of a frog,” Justice said.\nHe did not go into detail on what those changes would entail.\nSALT shakers\nThe state and local tax deduction, or SALT, represents another tightrope for Thune, who is no fan of the changes made in the House. But he has said repeatedly this week he understands altering that language too much could mean a Senate-amended version of the bill never makes it back through the House to actually become law.\nThune said outside the White House following a June 4 meeting with Trump and others that there will very likely be changes to SALT.\n“There isn’t a single Republican senator who cares much about the SALT issue,” Thune said. “It’s just not an issue that plays.” States that are most affected generally don’t elect Republicans to the Senate.\nThe House tax-writing panel originally proposed raising the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000, but Johnson had to raise that to $40,000 in order to secure votes from House Republicans who represent higher tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. The revised cap would benefit more high-income taxpayers in their states.\n“In 2017, that was one of the best reforms we had in the bill,” Thune said. “But we understand it’s about 51 and 218. So we will work with our House counterparts and with the White House to try to get that issue in a place where we can deliver the votes and get the bill across the finish line.”\nRepublicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but can rely on Vice President J.D. Vance to break a tied vote if necessary.\nAt least 218 House lawmakers must vote to pass bills when all 435 seats are filled. But with three vacancies at the moment, legislation can move through that chamber with 216 votes. The GOP has 220 seats at the moment, meaning Johnson can afford four defections on party-line bills.\nNorth Dakota Sen. John Hoeven told reporters this week that he’d like to see GOP senators rework the SALT section of the bill, even if that causes challenges for Speaker Johnson’s ability to pass a final version.\n“Let’s talk about SALT, for example. The House has a very large SALT number. The Senate is probably going to take a look at that,” Hoeven said. “There’ll be a lot of areas we can look at. There’ll be other things we’re going to look at. We’d like to get to $2 trillion in savings.”\nOhio Sen. Bernie Moreno joined in putting his House colleagues on notice that they likely won’t get the agreement they struck with the speaker in the final version of the bill.\n“I think we’re going to make common-sense changes. For example, the SALT cap, by the way, something that definitely helps very wealthy people in blue states,” Moreno said. “I think that cap, the 400% increase, is too much, so we’re going to work on tweaking that.”\nHawley, of Missouri, speaking more generally about the tax provisions, said he would like the Senate to make sure middle-class Americans benefit from the tax changes, just as much as companies.\n“I want to be clear, I’m in favor of additional tax relief for working people. So my view is this corporate tax rate, which they lowered in 2017, they made that permanent back then. I know some workers that would like permanent tax relief,” Hawley said. “So I think it’s imperative that we do some addition to tax relief for workers. So I think that’s important.”\nA new $4 trillion debt limit\nDeficit hawks in the Senate have also voiced objections to raising the nation’s debt limit by $4 trillion, arguing that GOP leaders haven’t done enough to assuage their concerns about the nation’s fiscal trajectory.\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued that the debt limit increase is more about next year’s midterm elections than good governance.\n“This is really about avoiding having to talk about the debt during election times because people like to go home and talk to the Rotary or the Lions Club and tell them how they’re fiscally conservative and they’re against debt,” Paul said. “It’s embarrassing to them to have to vote to keep raising the debt. But they’re unwilling to have the courage to actually look at all spending.”\nPaul suggested that House Republicans created problems by inflating some of the spending levels in their package, including to continue construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Paul is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n“The $46.5 billion for the wall is eight times higher than the current cost of the wall. If you’re going to do 1,000 miles, you can actually do it for $6.5 billion. They want $46.5 billion,” Paul said. “We can’t be fiscally conservative until it comes to the border, and then we’re no longer fiscally conservative.”\nThe border wall has been a constant focus for Trump, who made it a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign, when he said repeatedly that the United States would build it and Mexico would pay for it.\nSouth Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Budget Committee, hinted during a brief interview that Congress can only cut so much spending without going near programs like Social Security, which accounted for $1.5 trillion in expenditures last year, or Medicare, which spent $865 billion. Both are normally considered untouchable.\n“I think we’re going to make some changes to try to find more spending reductions. I think that’s a fair criticism of the bill, but you can’t do Social Security by law,” Graham said, referring to one of the many rules that govern the reconciliation process. “Nobody’s proposed anything in the Medicare area.”\nGraham added that “trying to make the bill more fiscally responsible is a good thing, but we need to pass it.”\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (let’s say “OBBBA”) is President Donald Trump’s signature agenda item in Congress. It will affect the daily lives of tens of millions of Americans.

Without action, nearly all individuals will see a tax increase. Standard deductions. The Senate draft would give most adults a bigger tax deduction from the start. Without extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the standard deduction that many individuals take to lower their tax burden is slated to decrease nearly in half at the end of the year. The Senate would not just keep but raise the deduction amounts — to $16,000 for individuals and $32,000 for married couples filing jointly. Child tax credit. The current tax credit of $2,000 per child is set to drop to $1,000 at the end of the year. The Senate would raise the credit to $2,200 permanently. The House would raise the credit to $2,500, but only until 2028. Green energy A slash to green energy funds. The House and Senate are both moving to eliminate major tax credits for wind and solar from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But the Senate gives a slightly longer phase-out, allowing a partial tax credit for projects that start construction next year or in 2027. The House would end the credit almost as soon as the bill is enacted. Medicaid Targeting the “provider” tax. This is the most notable cut that the Senate draft is adding. Right now, states use a loophole to help them get more federal dollars for Medicaid. They tax hospitals and doctors (a “provider tax”) and spend that money back with the hospitals and doctors. The more states spend, the more the federal government will match. A cut on this tax. For states that expanded Medicaid, the Senate draft would gradually reduce the maximum amount of provider taxes, which is currently up to 6%, until it reaches a 3.5% threshold by 2031. Many Republicans like this reform, but others say it would significantly cut funds available for Medicaid. The House bill would block new provider taxes. Work requirements. Both the House and Senate would add an 80-hours-a-month work requirement for “able-bodied” adults, or those without disabilities, on Medicaid. The Senate makes one significant change: exempting parents of children under 14 years old from the requirement. (There currently is no federal work requirement for Medicaid.) What now? This Senate version is experiencing some initial turbulence. Four Republican senators have openly questioned the Medicaid cuts in the House bill: Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri. And now, West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice has told a Semafor reporter that he wants the Senate’s Medicaid section to revert to the House version, which would ban new or increased provider taxes. Hawley told me Tuesday that the cut to the provider tax was a total surprise to him and others. Trump, too, was surprised when alerted about the change and its ramifications for rural hospitals, Hawley said. This is not unusual. Big bills often have big problems when they are released. But. Republicans are trying to get this historic legislation through Congress — not just the Senate — in the next two weeks.

            "Speaker Johnson launches sales mission as ‘big, beautiful bill’ hits the Senate. Speaker Johnson launches sales mission as ‘big, beautiful bill’ hits the Senate\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is on a sales mission for the “big, beautiful bill” full of President Trump’s legislative priorities, defending its contents amid a wave of criticism from his party about the depth of spending cuts, significance of Medicaid changes and the rollback of green-energy tax credits.\nJohnson said in multiple interviews that he sent a “long text message” to Elon Musk vouching for the bill after the billionaire tech mogul said he was disappointed with the legislation, complaining that it undermines the cost-cutting work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his brainchild.\nThe Speaker has also gone on a cable news blitz, pushing back on concerns Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are voicing about the deficit impact of the bill, tearing into the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s math, and arguing that the benefits of the package outweigh its shortcomings.\nAnd now, Speaker Johnson is looking to ease concerns of conservatives by promising to quickly stage a vote on a bill that would claw back billions of dollars in federal funding — reflecting some of the cuts DOGE has made — and signaling there may be more to come after the “one big, beautiful bill” gets to the president’s desk.\n“This is not the only reconciliation bill,” Johnson said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “We’re going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this, and we’re beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government.”\nThe full-court press comes as the bill is making its debut in the Senate, where Republicans say they plan to make changes to the sprawling package, threatening to erode the delicate support for the legislation in the narrow House GOP majority.\nJohnson has publicly and privately urged his upper chamber colleagues to keep their alterations minimal.\nAt least on one issue, the Senate appears to be listening.\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), a former House member who has acted as a liaison between the two chambers, told The Hill last week that he does not expect the Senate to change the $40,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap in the bill, which had emerged as a major sticking point in the House.\n“I don’t think we can change that,” Mullin said. “I don’t think you can drop it. I think if you go below $40,000, I think it causes issues.”\nSALT had been one of the biggest questions heading into the Senate’s turn with the bill. While quadrupling the deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 was a central priority for moderate House Republicans from high-tax blue states like New York, New Jersey and California, the issue has no GOP advocates in the Senate — a dynamic those in the upper chamber openly recognized.\nAs of now, the House is winning the argument.\n“In the Senate, we don’t have any dog in the fight, right? Zero,” Mullin said. “But in the House, it does, and I don’t think it’s a do-or-die on our side.”\nWhile the SALT question may be adjudicated, the Senate still has to make decisions on a host of high-stakes issues, including whether to beef up spending cuts, water down Medicaid changes or minimize the rollback of green-energy tax credits — any of which could derail the House’s tenuous equilibrium.\nMullin, for his part, said the entire Republican trifecta has been closely coordinating throughout the process.\n“We’ve been talking together the whole time,” he said. “So, the House and the Senate and the White House have been talking this whole time together, so I don’t see there being a huge difference between us.”\nBut to keep the trains on the track in the House, Johnson will have to continue his messaging blitz and put out any fires that arise as the Senate parses the package’s particulars.\nIt is a role shift for Johnson, who spent months in closed-door meetings corralling the fractious House Republican Conference around the behemoth bill — culminating in a through-the-night saga on the House floor to pass it out of the chamber as fast as possible after securing the support it needed.\nBut while Johnson met his Memorial Day deadline to pass the bill out of the House after last-minute negotiations, the rest of the Republican ecosystem is not yet on board with its contents — or up to speed on what made the cut and what did not.\nThat’s led to Johnson’s blitz being as much of an education campaign as it is an advocacy mission.\n“This is not a spending bill. This is a reconciliation package. It is reconciling the budget,” Johnson said on “Meet the Press.”\n“We’re beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government. And you’re going to see a lot of the DOGE cuts and a lot of this new fiscal restraint reflected in what Congress does next,” Johnson said. “So stay tuned, this is not the end-all, be-all.”\nIn a show of that commitment, Johnson has pledged to swiftly act on a package from the White House expected to hit Congress this week that would mark the first codification of DOGE cuts — action that the outraged conservative base had been clamoring for. The $9.4 billion rescission package would claw back spending from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, as well as from the largely dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development.\nAnd as for those pesky budget projections forecasting the bill adds trillions to the national debt over a decade, Johnson argues the budget scorers don’t adequately assess the impact of economic growth spurred by the tax cut extension or other Trump policies.\n“The president’s extraordinary policies are producing great things for the country. The tariff policy that was so controversial in the beginning is having an extraordinary effect on the U.S. economy,” Johnson said, in contrast to numerous analysts who say the tariffs will damage economic growth.\nDespite the looming fights in the Senate, Johnson remains confident the party will meet its self-imposed deadline of enacting the package by July 4 — betting he will be able to pull another rabbit out of his hat.\n“They’ve always discounted us,” Johnson said Sunday. “I mean, I said I would do it out of the House before Memorial Day, and I was laughed at when I said that back early part of the year. But we beat it by four days, OK? We’re going to get this done, the sooner the better.”\n“Because all these extraordinary benefits that we’re talking about have to happen as soon as possible,” he added. And I’m convinced that the Senate will do it, do the right thing, send it back to us. We’re going to get it to the president’s desk, and we’re all going to have a glorious celebration on Independence Day, by July Fourth when he gets this signed into law.”\nAl Weaver contributed.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

            "Trump tariffs expected to increase prices over the summer, says Powell – live. Trump tariffs expected to increase prices over the summer, says Powell\nCallum Jones\nPowell cautions that officials expect tariffs imposed by Trump to increase prices over the course of the summer.\nWe’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit and, of course, we expect – as you point out – we do expect to see more of that over the course of the summer.\nHe goes on:\nIncreases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could be more persistent.\nAvoiding persistent inflation “will depend on the size of the tariff effects” and how long it takes them to impact prices, Powell adds.\nAuthorities announced earlier this week that alleged shooter Vance Boelter had visited the homes of four lawmakers in Minnesota, ultimately shooting people at two of them.\nOne of the lawmakers whose homes was targeted has now released a statement. State representative Kristin Bahner was out of town when the shooter came to her door in Maple Grove, a suburb of Minneapolis. She thanked law enforcement and her neighbors, and she expressed grief at the loss of Melissa Hortman.\nHer statement reads:\nThe past several days have been surrounded by so much grief and fear. This senseless violence came to my door as well, placing me and my family in harm’s way.\nI do not know why this man was filled with such hatred that he would come to my door; divine intervention led my family to change our plans keeping us safe.\nOver the past several days, I have spent time shielding my family from grief and worry, in the hope that they can remain unscathed. Yet these events rarely leave us without marks; they will forever change us.\nBahner said she would seek to honor Hortman’s legacy and that Hortman would have found a way to bring people together and lift people up at this moment.\nMy response to bad trouble visiting my door will be met with good trouble. I will continue to lead for my community and work to improve the lives of all Minnesotans.\nPowell says he's not thinking about his re-appointment prospects\nA reporter asks Powell: “Assuming you are not re-appointed, would you stay on as governor when your term ends?”\nPowell’s reply is curt.\nI’m not thinking about that. I’m thinking about this.\nEarlier today, Trump mused about appointing himself to lead the US central bank, based on his dissatisfaction with Powell. He said:\nMaybe I should go to the Fed. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? I’d do a much better job than these people.\nTrump has long criticized Powell and sparked market concern earlier this year when he suggested the central bank chief’s termination couldn’t come fast enough.\nTrump has since walked back from that rhetoric, saying he would not fire Powell before his term as chair ends next year, but he has not held back on his broader criticism – including calling Powell “stupid” and a “major loser” – and has made clear that he will not ask Powell to stay on as the central bank’s leader.\nPowell said earlier that Fed policy makers expect inflation in goods prices to go up over the course of the summer as the impact of Trump’s tariffs work their way to US consumers.\nHe said it takes time for tariffs to work through the goods chain of distribution, noting many goods being sold by retailers were imported months before tariffs were imposed.\nSo we’re beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over coming months. We do also see price increases in some of the relevant categories, like personal computers and audio visual equipment and things like that attributable to tariff increases.\nOn keeping interest rates where they are, Powell says:\nAs long as the economy is solid, as long as we’re seeing the kind of labor market that we have and reasonably decent growth, and inflation moving down, we feel like the right thing to do is to be where we are, and learn more.\nAnd in particular we feel like we’re going to learn a great deal more over the summer on tariffs. We hadn’t expected them to show up much by now and they haven’t. And we will see the extent to which they do over coming months. That’s going to inform our thinking.\nIn addition we’ll see how the labor market progresses. At some point it will become clear. I can’t tell you when that will be. We’ll be watching the labor market carefully for signs of weakness and strength and tariffs for signs of what’s going to happen there. There are many developments ahead, even in the near term, developments are expected on tariffs.\nSo I think we don’t yet know with any confidence where they will settle out. We have an estimate. All estimates are now pretty close together. But it’s uncertain.\nTrump tariffs expected to increase prices over the summer, says Powell\nCallum Jones\nPowell cautions that officials expect tariffs imposed by Trump to increase prices over the course of the summer.\nWe’ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit and, of course, we expect – as you point out – we do expect to see more of that over the course of the summer.\nHe goes on:\nIncreases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.

It’s also possible that the inflationary effects could be more persistent.\nAvoiding persistent inflation “will depend on the size of the tariff effects” and how long it takes them to impact prices, Powell adds.\nThe Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy - maximum employment and stable prices, Powell says.\nWe remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well, anchored, he says.\nFor the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance, he says.\nThe effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level, he says.\nIt’s also possible that the inflationary effects could be more persistent, he adds.\nAvoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices and ultimately on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well accurate, says Powell.\nChanges to trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policies continue to evolve and their effects on the economy remain uncertain, Powell says, adding that the effects of tariffs will depend on their ultimate level.\nExpectations of the level and economic effects reached a peak in April and have since declined, he says, adding that even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.\nWithin PDFP, Powell says, growth of consumer spending moderated while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter.\nSurveys of households and businesses report a decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns, he says.\nIt remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment, Powell says.",

            "Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind. Inflation likely moved higher last month as tariffs bite, putting the Fed in bind\nInflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald ...\nWASHINGTON -- Inflation likely ticked up in July for the third straight month as tariffs lift the cost of imported goods such as furniture, appliances, and toys, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates as President Donald Trump has demanded.\nConsumer prices are forecast to have risen 2.8% in July from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That annual pace would be up from 2.7% in June and a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to rise to 3%, from 2.9% in June. Both figures are well above the Fed's 2% price target.\nThe potential increases, while modest, would put the Fed in a difficult spot: Hiring slowed sharply in the spring, after Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs in April. The stalling out of job gains has boosted financial market expectations for an interest rate cut by the central bank.\nYet Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned that worsening inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines — a stance that has enraged Trump, who has defied traditional norms of central bank independence and demanded lower borrowing costs.\nTuesday's data will also arrive at a highly-charged moment for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the inflation data. Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, then the head of BLS, after the Aug. 1 jobs report also showed sharply lower hiring for May and June than had previously been reported.\nThe president posted on social media Monday that he has picked E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a frequent critic of the jobs report, to replace McEntarfer.\n“E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said on Truth Social.\nAdding to the BLS's turmoil is a government-wide hiring freeze that has forced it to cut back on the amount of data it collects for each inflation report, the agency has said. UBS economist Alan Detmeister estimates that BLS is now collecting about 18% fewer price quotes for the inflation report than it did a few months ago. He thinks the report will produce more volatile results, though averaged out over time, still reliable.\nOn a monthly basis, prices are expected to rise modestly, increasing just 0.2% from June to July and core prices rising 0.3%. Gas prices likely fell in July and grocery costs are expected to barely increase, muting overall inflation.\nSigns of duties pushing up prices first emerged in the June inflation report released last month. Toy prices jumped 1.8% from May to June, after a 1.3% increase the previous month. Clothing prices rose 0.4% in June, while sporting goods leapt 1.8%.\nMeanwhile, the average tariff level has climbed from about 2% before Trump's inauguration to nearly 18%, the highest since the early 1930s, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. Most imports from the European Union and Japan now face duties of 15%, while goods from Taiwan pay 20% and Switzerland, 39%.\nOther trends are helping keep inflation from rising more quickly. Price increases for apartment rents, for example, are steadily cooling after sharp spikes during the pandemic era. And prices for new cars have declined slightly in recent months, even after Trump slapped 25% duties on autos and auto parts.\nSo far, U.S. and overseas carmakers are paying the tariffs, though economists say they likely will pass them on to consumers soon. Car companies are also paying 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum and 30% on parts from China.\nFord has said it paid $800 million in tariffs in the second quarter, while General Motors shouldered $1.1 billion. Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker and the maker of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, has said it has paid $350 million in tariffs out of a $1.7 billion expected cost this year.\nConsumers are likely to absorb more costs beyond the auto industry in the coming months, as Trump has begun to finalize many tariffs. Once businesses know what they will be paying, they are more likely to pass those costs to consumers, economists say.\nTrump has insisted that overseas manufacturers will pay the tariffs by reducing their prices to offset the duties. Yet the pre-tariff prices of imports haven't fallen much since the levies were put in place.\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs estimate that foreign manufacturers have absorbed just 14% of the duties through June, while 22% has been paid by consumers and 64% by U.S. companies. Based on previous patterns, however — such as Trump's 2018 duties on washing machines — the economists expect that by this fall consumers will bear 67% of the burden, while foreign exporters pay 25% and U.S. companies handle just 8%.\nMany large firms are still raising prices in response to the tariffs, including apparel makers Ralph Lauren and Under Armour, and eyewear company Warby Parker.\nConsumer products giant Procter & Gamble, maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said late last month that it would lift prices on about a quarter of its products by mid-single-digit percentages.\nAnd cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes a majority of its products in China, said on Wednesday that it had raised prices by a dollar on its entire product assortment as of Aug. 1 because of tariff costs, the third price hike in its 21-year history.\n“We tend to lead and then we will see how many more kind of follow us,” CEO Tarang Amin said on an earnings call Wednesday.\nMatt Pavich, CEO of Revionics, a company that provides AI tools to large retailers to help them evaluate pricing decisions, says many companies are raising prices selectively to offset tariffs, rather than across the board.\n“Up until now we haven't seen a massive hit to consumers in retail prices,” Pavich said. “Now, they are going up, we've seen that.”\n____\nAssociated Press Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

            "Adidas, Walmart, Home Depot, and other major brands that say Trump's tariffs are pushing them to raise prices. Trump's tariffs have led some companies to announce that they plan to raise prices.\n-\nEven before his so-called \"Liberation Day,\" companies warned they would pass costs on to shoppers.\n-\nBusiness Insider is tracking companies that have said they'll raise prices due to tariffs — and those that already have.\n-\nPrices are expected to go up this year as many companies signal plans to raise them in response to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.\nWhile firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming price hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. That's when he announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from most countries, except Canada and Mexico, and a host of \"reciprocal\" tariffs on top of that.\nThe situation is fluid, as various countries continue to negotiate potential trade deals with the US.\nSome economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce.\nHere are the companies that have implemented or warned of price increases in recent months.\nAdidas\nAdidas said it will raise prices in the US because of a double-digit million euro hit from tariffs in the second quarter and a further predicted 200 million euro, about $218 million, cost from levies in the second half of the year.\nVietnam, which accounted for 27% of the German retailer's total volume in 2024, will face a 20% tariff from August 1. Indonesia made 19% of Adidas' products and will face a 19% tariff.\nCEO Bjørn Gulden said in a statement accompanying Adidas's latest results that the company doesn't know \"what the indirect impact on consumer demand will be should all these tariffs cause major inflation.\"\nAutoZone\nPhilip Daniele, the CEO of the auto-parts company AutoZone, told analysts on a September earnings call that tariff policies had \"ebbed and flowed over the years,\" and if Trump implemented more tariffs, \"we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer.\"\n\"We generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said, adding that prices would gradually settle over time. \"So, that's historically what we've done,\" he said.\nA 25% tariff on car imports is expected to increase manufacturing costs by anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.\nBest Buy\nBest Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices.\n\"Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex,\" Barry said. \"We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.\"\nCamera makers Nikon, Canon, and Leica\nSeveral big suppliers of photography equipment have announced their own price hikes.\n\"Due to the recent tariffs, a necessary price adjustment for products will take effect on June 23, 2025. We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,\" Nikon said in an announcement in May.\nIn its first-quarter earnings call, Canon said it will raise prices but is still \"in the process of estimating the timing and amount of the increase.\"\nAt Leica, price increases across some product lines took effect May 1.\n\"This is not a Leica-initiated price increase, but a result of the newly enacted tariffs that began on April 5 on imported products, which are significantly impacting the cost of imported goods, including photographic equipment and optics,\" Leica USA Trade Marketing and Product Communications Manager Nathan Kellum-Pathe said in a statement to Digital Camera World in April.\nConagra\nConagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.\nConnolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico.\nIt was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he said.\nColumbia Sportswear\nTim Boyle, the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, told analysts on an October earnings call that the company was \"very concerned about the imposition of tariffs. \" He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, \"trade wars are not good and not easy to win.\"\nBoyle also told The Washington Post in October that the company was \"set to raise prices.\"\n\"It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans,\" he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that \"we need some surety about what is going to happen\" before making price changes.\nMacy's\nIn its Q1 earnings report on May 28, Macy's announced it was reducing its earnings outlook for the year because of several factors, including higher tariffs and consumers' moderating their discretionary spending.\nIn a post-earnings call, Macy's CEO, Tony Spring, added that the department store chain would be raising prices on some items to account for higher tariffs.\nSpring said that higher \"pricing is working its way into the system slowly,\" adding, \"That's why we have taken a more cautious approach to our outlook for the year.\"\nThe company's COO and CFO, Adrian Mitchell, followed up to Spring's comment. \"We are not just broadly increasing price,\" he said. \"We're being incredibly surgical about the situation with tariffs.\"\nHe added, \"We're making selective price increase in selective brands, selective categories. So some of the impact on our gross margin this year is going to be around the tariffs.\"\nThe news comes in the midst of Macy's plan to close around 150 underperforming stores around the country by 2027 as it leans into expanding its luxury brands, including the high-end department store Bloomingdale's and beauty chain Bluemercury.\nFerrari\nItalian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2.\nThe change was made \"based on the preliminary information currently available regarding the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA,\" the company said.\nFord\nFord raised prices in May on some models produced in Mexico, Reuters reported based on a notice sent to dealers.\nBloomberg also reported that the automaker planned to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs.\nFord, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates \"the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production.\" Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now.\nOn April 14, Trump told reporters that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the US — but no blanket exemption has yet been instituted.\nHermès\nEric du Halgouët, executive vice president of finance at the company, told analysts on a call in April that Hermès, the luxury retailer known for its iconic Birkin handbags, hadn't yet been affected by the tariffs, but said the company would raise prices in the US in May.\n\"The price increase that we're going to implement will be just for the US. Since it's aimed at offsetting the increase in tariffs, that only applies to the American market,\" du Halgouët said on the call.\nHome Depot\nHome Depot said during its August earnings call that tariffs will start affecting some price tags in the coming months.\n\"There'll be some modest price movement in some categories, but it won't be broad-based,\" said William Bastek, the home improvement chain's executive vice president of merchandising.\nA majority of Home Depot's products are sourced within the US, which means they aren't subject to tariffs, Bastek said.\nHowever, regarding some of the company's imported items, he said, \"tariff rates are significantly higher today than they were when we spoke in May,\" referring to the company's previous earnings call.\nThe company still aims to keep the cost of an overall shopping trip down.\n\"Our customers tend to shop for the entire project — you think about a small flooring project, tile, the grout, bathtub, and vanity in a bath project,\" he said. \"And so we're laser-focused on protecting the cost of the entire project.\"\nNike\nNike is planning to raise prices in order to offset an expected $1 billion additional tariff costs in the 2026 fiscal year, the company told investors in a June 26 earnings call.\n\"These tariffs represent a new and meaningful cost headwind,\" said CFO Matthew Friend during the analyst call about Nike's 2025 fiscal year.\nThe company said it plans to implement a \"surgical price increase\" starting this fall in the US, with \"phased implementation.\" The company hasn't revealed which products will be affected, or by how much prices will increase.\nNintendo\nWhile Nintendo's Switch 2 console hasn't seen a price hike due to tariffs, the company has raised the price of some earlier Switch models and accessories based on \"market conditions.\"\nOther \"price adjustments may be necessary in the future,\" the company said in August.\nProcter & Gamble\nP&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products.\nCEO Jon Moeller told CNBC in April that price hikes were \"likely.\"\n\"We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L,\" P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters.\nThe company is evaluating \"exactly what is the right plan by brand, by market, what combination of pricing, over what period of time,\" Schulten said.\nShein and Temu\nThe two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: \"Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up.\"\n\"To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025,\" Shein's statement said.\nShein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping.\nIn addition to hiking tariffs on imports from China, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole.\nStanley Black & Decker\nDonald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: \"Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months.\"\nAllan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating \"a variety of different scenarios\" to plan for new tariffs under Trump.\n\"And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market,\" Allan said, adding that \"there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price.\"\nTarget\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce.\n\"Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,\" Cornell said.\nSome prices at the store have already gone up.\nVolkswagen\nAccording to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports.\nKjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June.\nWalmart\nOn May 15, Walmart executives said price increases were likely to spike even higher, blaming Trump's ongoing trade war.\n\"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" CEO Doug McMillon said during the company's first quarter earnings call.\nUS sales were boosted by shoppers looking to beat tariff-related price hikes — but despite strong first-quarter results, Walmart's chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said the extra costs are too great for the company to take on without passing part of the burden on to consumers.\n\"We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Walmart workers have shared photos of price hikes being applied to store products.\nHow have prices affected you?

            "Teachers and Students Are Rising Up to Defend Anti-Racist Education in the US. “Our students demand to learn the truth even if a small group of powerful, mostly wealthy, white adults is threatened by that,” insisted Michael Rebne, a teacher at Wyandotte High School in Kansas City. “At this moment we are seeing a rise in both Islamophobia and antisemitism stoked by the same right-wing forces that seek to further marginalize LGBTQIA+ students and the voices of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian and all people of color. We need to set the record straight and see that we are stronger united.”\nEducators in the United States unwilling to turn their lessons into press releases for Israel’s far-right prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have faced harsh censure, especially since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, enforced collective starvation, bombed schools and hospitals, and committed a host of other war crimes—atrocities that honest educators believe students have a right to learn about.\nRadhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, which defends the free speech rights of Palestine advocates, revealed the alarming escalation in these attacks: “We’ve had an exponential surge in requests for legal help. It has been like nothing we’ve seen before.” In just the month of October 2023, the organization responded to nearly two hundred reports of “suppression of Palestinian rights advocacy”—almost as many incidents as they addressed in all of the previous year.\nThe repression of education about Palestine has contributed to the proliferation of violence against Palestinian youth. Six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was stabbed by his family’s landlord twenty-six times and killed in October 2023. In November 2023, Hisham Awartani, Tahseen Ali, and Kenan Abdulhamid, three Palestinian college students, were walking together in Burlington, Vermont—two of them wearing kaffiyehs—when a hateful assailant shot and wounded all three and left Awartani paralyzed from the waist down.\nThe crackdown on advocates for Palestinian rights has taken various forms. According to Sainath, individuals have faced consequences ranging from job terminations due to supportive tweets or social media messages about Palestinian human rights to student critics of Israel being doxed and listed on a website called “College Terror List,” aiming to render them unemployable. Death threats have even been made to students and teachers.\nAn elementary charter school in Los Angeles fired two teachers for sharing “a lesson on the genocide in Palestine.” A school in Illinois banned students from wearing a kaffiyeh scarf—a Palestinian cultural symbol. In Palm Beach County, Florida, a first-grade teacher was investigated by the school district and put on administrative leave for asking the superintendent to “publicly recognize the Palestinian community” while communicating about the violence in the Middle East. Four teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, were placed on administrative leave for public expressions of support for Palestinians. The Decatur, Georgia, school district suspended their equity coordinator for sharing “Resources for Learning & Actions to Support Gaza.” In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fifteen-year-old Palestinian American Jad Abuhamda was expelled from Pine Crest School because of social media posts—not from him, but from his mother who wrote about the “collective brutality” that Israel was waging against Palestinians.\nSeveral universities have suspended campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, including Columbia, Brandeis, George Washington, and Rutgers. Many politicians—both Republicans and Democrats—were more outraged by the students who camped out in tents on college campuses in the spring of 2024 to protest genocide than they were by Israel bombing Palestinian refugees in their tents. Many of these peaceful college student protesters were arrested, suspended, or denied graduation because they spoke out against genocide.\nThese neo-McCarthyist tactics to prohibit honest education about Palestine aren’t new, even if they are intensified. Steven Salaita was fired from the University of Illinois after he publicly criticized Israel’s 2014 military assault on Gaza with tweets such as, “Only Israel can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim.” Bahia Amawai was an educator who worked for a school in a suburban district outside of Austin, Texas, as a speech-language pathologist working with elementary school children with autism, disabilities, and speech impediments. She was fired in 2018 when she refused to sign what amounted to a pro-Israel loyalty oath that demanded she “not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.”\nAnd it isn’t only red states that have attacked educators critical of Israeli policies or education that seeks to allow students to see the full humanity of Palestinians. Nearly fifty years after the Third World Liberation Front strikes at San Francisco State and University of California, Berkeley, created the first ethnic studies courses, California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill in September 2016 to create an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, which would “provide direction for districts interested in implementing high school ethnic studies courses.”\nIn August 2019, the draft curriculum went up for public comment. However, a “well-organized right-wing campaign headed by a pro-Israel lobby committed to preventing any critical discussion of Israel, flooded the CDE [California Department of Education] demands to remove the Arab American curriculum—especially all mention of Palestine—and the anti-colonial, anti- racist framing of the entire curriculum.”\nThen the California Department of Education and Governor Newsom caved. A formidable coalition in support of California’s Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum emerged, including the Association for Asian American Studies, the Arab American Studies Association, Black Lives Matter, Jewish Voice for Peace, veterans of the 1968 student strikes for ethnic studies, and many internationally recognized scholars, such as Angela Davis and Robin D. G. Kelley. “Progressive Jewish educators and activists made it clear that the pro-Israel lobby does not speak for them,” wrote truth teacher and co-coordinator of the Teach Palestine Project, Jody Sokolower.\nDuring this struggle, a student named Hedaia addressed California’s Instructional Quality Commission, the body charged with overseeing the process. “I am a Palestinian Arab student,” she said, adding:\nDo you know how it feels to be called a terrorist by your teacher and classmates? It’s dehumanizing. As much as I tried to assimilate at my high school, I was always a scary Arab with a hard name to pronounce. This is how I grew up, facing Islamophobic and Arab slurs in and out of school. Explaining myself in classes where Arabs and Muslims are mentioned for one day each year: on Sept. 11. My people are not the stereotypes. We are teachers, students, health care workers, politicians, everything. By removing Arab American studies from the central curriculum, you are removing the existence of people who have contributed to this society and need to be represented in a positive light. Representation matters.\nThere is no question that antisemitism is also on the rise; but it’s important to understand that the uncritical race theorists who have attacked antiracist teaching are the same ones who are primarily responsible for the rise in anti-Jewish sentiment—not Palestinians or hundreds of millions of people around the world who have participated in the movement for a ceasefire in Gaza. Remember that when protestors confronted the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, North Carolina, who chanted, “Jews will not replace us,” then president Donald Trump said there were “fine people on both sides.” This contributed to the fact that when Trump attacked CRT in the wake of the 2020 uprising for Black lives, anti-Black education policy also coincided with a rise in antisemitism.\nIn 2022, the McMinn County School Board in Tennessee voted unanimously to ban the Pulitzer Prize–winning graphic novel Maus. In Texas, the Carroll Independent School District held a training for educators, where the executive director of curriculum and instruction explained in an online forum to teachers how to determine which books teachers can keep in classroom libraries.\nIn despicable remarks captured on an audio recording, the director instructed teachers to remember the requirements of the new Texas anti-CRT law, “and make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives”—an abhorrent, antisemitic expression of uncritical race theory that asserts there could be a legitimate way to deny the Holocaust happened or show support for the Nazi genocide of more than six million Jewish people.\nIn the context of Governor Ron DeSantis’s “Stop WOKE” act, a school in Indian River County, Florida, banned the book Anne Frank’s Diary: The Graphic Adaptation—a 2019 retelling of the diary Anne Frank wrote while hiding out for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. In addition, DeSantis directed his department of education to ban two textbooks about the Holocaust.\nAt the same time DeSantis’s policies have bolstered antisemitism, the governor is one of the most zealous defenders of Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. For example, he has called for banning Palestinian refugees from entering the United States and boasted that he sent weapons and ammunition to Israel from the state of Florida to aid the destruction of Gaza.\nAdditionally, despite his outrage over cancel culture, DeSantis issued a ban on Students for Justice in Palestine on Florida’s college campuses. This aligns with a larger trend where the right suppresses educational initiatives that aim to honestly confront antisemitism while unequivocally endorsing Israel’s attack on Palestinians. This support for Israel isn’t rooted in genuine concern for the Jewish community; rather, it serves to bolster the Israeli state as a strategic ally to the United States in the oil-rich Middle East.\nChristopher Rufo demonstrated this when he offered his colonial strategy for using education to help maintain Israeli and US military power: “Conservatives need to create a strong association between Hamas, BLM [Black Lives Matter], DSA [Democratic Socialists of America], and academic ‘decolonization’ in the public mind. Connect the dots, then attack, delegitimize, and discredit. Make the center-left disavow them. Make them political untouchables.”\nThe strategy of trying to make anyone who opposes genocide in Gaza a “political untouchable” has largely been advanced by attacking supporters of Palestine as being antisemitic. In doing so, they not only disregard the outpouring of Jewish activists nationwide advocating for a ceasefire but also dangerously intertwine the fate of the Jewish diaspora with the Israeli government’s war crimes—thus fueling actual antisemitism.\nThe largest and most influential human rights organizations in the world—including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch—have described Israel as an apartheid state. South Africa brought Israel up on charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice, arguing that Israel has been “intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, civilian objects and buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected; torture; the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare; and other war crimes and crimes against humanity.”\nThe International Court of Justice then issued a preliminary ruling finding the claim “plausible” and issued an order to Israel requiring them to take all measures within their power to prevent acts of genocide and to allow basic humanitarian services into Gaza. United Nations secretary-general António Guterres described Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza as turning it into a “graveyard for children.”\nJewish Voice for Peace issued a statement saying, “The Israeli government has declared a genocidal war on the people of Gaza. . . . This war is a continuation of the Nakba, when in 1948, tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing violence sought refuge in Gaza. It’s a continuation of 75 years of Israeli occupation and apartheid.”\nOn November 7, a group of Palestinian children held a press conference outside the al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, pleading for the world to intervene to stop Israel’s relentless bombing campaign. “Since October 7, we’ve faced extermination, killing, bombing over our heads—all of this in front of the world,” one young spokesperson for the group implored in English. “They lied to the world that they kill the fighters, but they kill the people of Gaza, their dreams and their future. Kids of Gaza run out of their hopes and wants.”\nThe children of Gaza are asking the world to stop lying. Honest educators believe that those who oppose Israeli repression and genocide—a movement made up of hundreds of millions of people all over the world— should not be censored in the classroom and that students have a right to learn about the movement for a free Palestine. “Young people are now watching genocide live streamed on social media as we speak, thousands more children are starved, injured, and murdered with weapons purchased with our United States tax dollars,” the children’s book author of Our Skin, Megan Madison, told me when I asked her about why it was important to resist truthcrime laws. “They don’t just want to ban books. They want to hurt trans kids. They want to silence Black progressive leadership, and they are preying on the trauma of Jewish people . . .” As challenging as it can be to teach truth about Palestine in the current period, as Rethinking Schools editorialized, “We should understand and take hope in the reason this backlash has grown in intensity: More people than ever are refusing to stay quiet in the face of racism and injustice.”\nKeep the press free.

            "Ex-Israeli Mediator Says Netanyahu’s Aim in Gaza Is Permanent War, Not Ceasefire. We get an update on ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel from former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy. The latest proposal, mediated by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, “walks back the commitment for a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal and allowing in of humanitarian aid.” It’s a bad deal for the Palestinians that will allow Israel to continue its ethnic cleansing of Gaza, says Levy. Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages are protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s delays in securing a deal as he works toward “permanent war” and the eventual annexation of Gaza. “None of this would be possible if so much of the Israeli media and society was not mobilized in support of this, and none of that would be possible if Israel wasn’t treated with impunity.” Levy also responds to the latest massacre of Palestinians at an aid site operated by the U.S.-Israeli aid initiative, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show with Gaza ceasefire talks, which are underway after Israeli military tanks opened fire Sunday and killed at least 30 Palestinians near Rafah in southern Gaza as they were waiting for aid. More than 170 others were wounded. Israel has denied responsibility. The aid site is operated by the U.S.-Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. This is a witness named Ibrahim Abu Saud, who described the attack to Al Jazeera.\nIBRAHIM ABU SAUD: [translated] They said there was aid, and we were supposed to enter at 5:30. We were advancing toward the Al-Alam roundabout near the sea, and there was a lot of gunfire. The quadcopters came and said there was no aid today. At 6:00, the tanks were firing, but no one was doing anything to the Israelis.\nAMY GOODMAN: Soon we’ll go to Gaza to talk more about the attack with a doctor who treated survivors and with a local NGO coordinator, but first we get an update on how negotiations are continuing over a possible ceasefire.\nOver the weekend, Hamas submitted its response to a proposal by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Hamas is offering to release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas is also seeking a complete end to Israel’s war on Gaza and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, but Witkoff has called Hamas’s response “totally unacceptable.”\nMeanwhile, in the United States, authorities in Boulder, Colorado, have arrested a man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and another incendiary device to attack a crowd of people taking part in a weekly walk honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza. Eight people were injured with burns, at least one in critical condition. The FBI said the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism.\nFor more, we’re joined in London by Daniel Levy, president of the U.S./Middle East Project, a former Israeli peace negotiator under Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin.\nDaniel, welcome back to Democracy Now! First, if you can talk about where the ceasefire proposal stands right now?\nDANIEL LEVY: Good to be back, Amy, although the circumstances continue and worsen in terms of how dire they are.\nThat ceasefire diplomacy, first of all, let’s be very clear, this doesn’t have to be a partial release of the Israelis being held. That’s a modality that the Israeli side has pushed for, instead of being willing to bring a total, definitive end to this, all the Israelis living and dead out, a full cessation, full withdrawal, etc. It’s important to remember that the agreement reached at the very beginning of Trump’s term, if people cast their minds back, Israelis being held were released. There were six weeks of a largely respected — not entirely on the Israeli side — ceasefire. That arrangement was that one would segue from a first phase into subsequent phases of releases towards a permanent ceasefire. Israel broke that ceasefire. It not only broke that ceasefire, but it launched probably the most barbaric of its assaults over the ensuing weeks, if one measures that in terms of the degree of the blockade and starvation regime imposed on Gaza. Talks resumed.\nWhere are we? The U.S. did something which should have been obvious all along, and further shame on the Biden administration that it didn’t do this. It spoke directly through envoys to Hamas. Adam Boehler, the hostage envoy, and subsequently someone called Bishara Bahbah, has been in direct talks with the Hamas leadership conducting these talks. They apparently reached an arrangement. That arrangement was apparently then rewritten at Israel’s assistance, put American stars and stripes on it and repackaged as an American proposal put forward by Witkoff. That seems to be Witkoff playing the regular game of America putting forward Israeli positions. That’s, if you like, channeling his inner Biden or Blinken. That proposal — let’s be very clear: That proposal walks back the commitment for a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal and allowing in of humanitarian aid.\nNow, given that the Israeli prime minister is basically telling us the following, that his government is telling us the following: “We can have a pause, we can get some of the Israelis back, and then we will resume our” — I’ll use the word — ‘genocide.’” They don’t quite say it, but they say everything that constitutes a genocide, that they will continue the ethnic cleansing, the squeezing of Palestinians into smaller areas in Gaza, the plans for resettlement, the killing, the destruction. By the way, they’re also pursuing similar goals in the West Bank. So, Netanyahu is saying, “You give us back some, and then your people can rest. Our soldiers can rest. Our troops can rest for 60-odd days. And then we’ll double down and make it even worse.” That is not a deal anyone should accept. The ball is now back in Witkoff and Netanyahu’s court. From what we’ve seen so far, one shouldn’t be hopeful. But that’s where we stand, Amy.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to what happened on Saturday in the streets of Tel Aviv, Israeli protesters demanding an immediate ceasefire and release of remaining hostages. This is Yotam Cohen, brother of hostage Nimrod Cohen.\nYOTAM COHEN: We are facing moral bankruptcy. Netanyahu is abandoning our loved ones in captivity and crushing the Israeli ethos upon which we were raised, for which, for his own political motives, we are left with no other option but to turn to the United States special envoy to the Middle East. Please, Mr. Witkoff, if the hostage deal outline is accepted, place a comprehensive deal on the table immediately, one that will end the war and ensure the return of all remaining hostages. Don’t let Netanyahu torpedo this deal and resume the fighting, the fighting that will cause the living hostages their lives.\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s the brother of hostage Nimrod Cohen. Also at the protest Saturday in Tel Aviv was protester Amram Zahavi.\nAMRAM ZAHAVI: And usually I want to apologize to the world to be a Jew and Israeli in a country that behaves like the Germany, the Nazis at 1940. I say that Israel is now a complete copy of what happened in Germany and the atrocity and the genocide that Israel is doing in Gaza.\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s Israeli protester Amram Zahavi. If you can respond, one, to the family member of a hostage and to these Israeli protesters in the streets? And does that put pressure on Netanyahu?\nDANIEL LEVY: I wish I could tell you that it puts the requisite level of pressure on Netanyahu. So, what we have, Amy, is a situation where many of the families of the Israelis still being held, and of those who have been released already, and their supporters have taken to the streets because they have clarity on this, that the person preventing this deal — not as Witkoff tells us, Hamas, just like Blinken and Biden told us, but it’s Netanyahu who’s preventing a deal, because he wants a permanent war. You now have a former Israeli prime minister acknowledging what the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, so much of the world has acknowledged for so many months, which is that Israel is committing war crimes. This is what former Prime Minister Olmert has said. You have 1,500-plus Israeli academics who have written to the heads of the universities, saying they must distance themselves from the war crimes that Israel is committing.\nIn the meantime, much of the Israeli official political opposition is against Netanyahu for a variety of reasons but is not calling out the crimes that are being committed, is not opposing his war. And Netanyahu sees his best political path as continuing the war, and he also sees that this is the fulfillment of the ideological vision of trying to permanently remove the Palestinians. Israel set up a directorate. I’ll give you the name of it. It’s the Directorate for the Voluntary Emigration of Gaza Residents, headed by a colonel, Yaakov Blitstein, inside the Defense Ministry. Now, there’s nothing voluntary about trying to get rid of people when you’re starving and kettling them into ever smaller areas.\nNone of this would be possible if so much of the Israeli media and society was not mobilized in support of this, and none of that would be possible, Amy, if Israel wasn’t treated with impunity externally. Of course, the U.S. leads that, but beyond it, we’re now hearing words. We’re now hearing much more relevant rhetoric from Israel’s Western allies, but we’re not seeing the commensurate actions. We’re not seeing Europeans, Canadians, others imposing an arms embargo, seizing Israeli foreign assets. We’re not seeing Israel isolated from international sport. As long as there is impunity, these crimes will continue.\nThere are people who say, Amy, that you have this tension between America first and Israel first inside Trump world, that the kind of cultural war of Palestine-Israel fought domestically — so, what’s being done with universities, with funding, with foreign students — by the way, we, of course, see the extremely courageous and very on-point messages in some of the commencement speeches. But that domestic deployment of Israel-Palestine is a little different from the geopolitical management, where the Trump administration have not gone along with Israel’s position on Iran, on the continuing to strike the Houthis — they did, and then they stopped — on Syria sanctions. They visited — he visited the Gulf, but not Israel. So, there is — there is some cracks there. There are some divisions. Unfortunately, what you don’t have is any acknowledgment of Palestinian humanity from this administration, but it is an administration talking to Hamas that conceivably could still put forward a ceasefire plan, but that will depend on much more pressure. That’s not where they are today, and that’s not the zeitgeist that we’re seeing.\nAMY GOODMAN: Very quickly, because we’re going to a doctor in Gaza, and you could imagine these hospitals are incredibly busy, I wanted to get your comment on Israel’s denial that it was involved in the killing of at least 30 Palestinians who went to get aid, who were told by quadcopters that they can go to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to get aid, and then were gunned down. Israel is saying it wasn’t them, the Israeli military, who did that. And also what happened in Boulder, this man, shirtless, with some kind of flamethrower, burning eight Americans who were standing in vigil for Israeli hostages?\nDANIEL LEVY: So, let me touch on that first. Of course, any attack on people exerting their right to protest, to rally anywhere, certainly including in the U.S., including in Boulder, Colorado, that’s a criminal act. That person should have the full force of the law brought against them. There’s no question in terms of condemning what was done there. I don’t see how anyone could condemn that but think it’s OK that in another part of the world a country shoots people who are desperately trying to get some aid and starves and besieges a population of 2 million-plus civilians. So, that’s the Boulder situation.\nLook, in terms of the Israeli denials, we understand that approximately 75 Palestinians have been killed in the under a week that this new authority has been functioning. I call it genocide profiteering, a private company distributing aid. Israel has denied. We’ve been here before, right, Amy? It’s not our first rodeo. Israel immediately issues its denial, comes up with some spurious counterclaim, hopes the news cycle moves on. In the end, we find out that the denials were worth precisely nothing. One has to acknowledge that the media has been banned from there. If Israel wanted to get its story out, let the media in. And if the media took itself seriously, then it would point that out — the mainstream media, I’m not talking about Democracy Now!, of course. There are citizen journalists who you can always turn to. There are people on the ground. You’re about to do that. So, there’s no credibility to that, to that claim.\nBut if I may, one point on this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, so-called, there is a mechanism to get aid to the people in Gaza. It’s tried and tested. It’s through the U.N. and other aid delivery systems that work according to humanitarian principles. Israel’s claim that Hamas has been siphoning off that aid, and that’s how it stays in power, has been repeated. It’s spurious. It has not been proven. What Israel is doing here by creating these zones, by making announcements on quadcopters, by sending people across great distances in Gaza, and then shooting those people, it is a layer of cruelty that tears at the very humanity of all of us, yet another layer of cruelty. And even if the Palestinians aren’t what keeps you awake at night, we should be clear that what Israel is establishing here in terms of undermining the fundamentals of global principles of humanitarian assistance should matter to everyone, just as the way Israel has used AI — Lavender, they called it — robotics in such appalling ways in their strikes in Gaza, and just as genocidal actions and narratives have been normalized. We have to bring an end to it. You’re about to hear the horrors of what is going on on the ground. Everyone must redouble their efforts to end this. Stop genocide, end apartheid, sanctions now.\nAMY GOODMAN: Daniel Levy, I want to thank you for being with us, president of the U.S./Middle East Project, former Israeli peace negotiator under Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin.\nWhen we come back, we go to Gaza to speak with a doctor who treated the wounded this weekend. Stay with us.\n[break]\nAMY GOODMAN: “Say Goodbye” by Michael Franti in our Democracy Now! studio.\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support.

            "Gaza Tribunal in Sarajevo Documents How Genocide Has Eroded International Law. Part of the Series\nStruggle and Solidarity: Writing Toward Palestinian Liberation\nDozens of lawyers, academics, human rights advocates, and journalists from Palestine, Israel, and global civil society issued a call to conscience on May 29 from a gathering in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dubbed the Sarajevo Declaration, the 2,000-word document was the culmination of the three-day preliminary hearing of the Gaza Tribunal, a newly formed people’s justice initiative aiming to voice “collective moral outrage” over what it described as Israel’s genocide of Palestinians and the decades of impunity for atrocities leading to it.\nThroughout three eight-hour days, the tribunal heard 45 back-to-back testimonies of research and analysis on the conditions of life and death in Gaza and across the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The entries — about obliteration of cultural heritage, violations of reproductive and disability rights, the weaponization of accusations of antisemitism, capital accumulation on Gaza’s rubble and in the West Bank, and otherwise — made a case beyond the charge of genocide, which members of the tribunal and a growing proportion of the global human rights community view as fact. Unbound by formal procedure and jurisdiction, tribunal members also brought in analysis of the context predating October 7, 2023. All together, they built an argument that the present stage of genocide in Palestine is the logical end point of a Zionism’s project of domination initiated before 1948 — and that the exceptions that have allowed it have also undermined international law, global cooperation and the United Nations system for all.\nIsrael and those enabling its actions “want Gaza to be the graveyard of international law,” said Raji Sourani, a Palestinian attorney from Gaza and founder and director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza City, in his address at the close of the tribunal’s first day. “Not for Gazans, not for Palestinians, but for the whole world.”\nThe semi-closed session on the hushed campus of the International University of Sarajevo was the Gaza Tribunal’s first meeting, with the final verdict planned for a last session in October. The proceedings — in their quasi-academic format of panels, PowerPoints, and papers — were both desperate in their desire to impede atrocities and self-conscious of the impossibility to meet the present horror: Israel’s military has intensified its aerial bombardment and blockade of Gaza, in addition to opening fire on people queued for food, leading to some of the deadliest days since Israel broke the last ceasefire in March.\nAs Israel advances its campaign against Palestinians, the tribunal is among a wave of recent mobilizations attempting to intervene outside of traditional judicial, diplomatic, and humanitarian spaces. For example, the Freedom Flotilla, a civilian ship stocked with aid, was sailing through international waters in the Mediterranean Sea toward Gaza’s coastline when it was intercepted by Israeli forces, and the activists onboard were detained on June 9. That day, a group of organizations and activists began the Global March to Gaza from Tunisia, hoping to cross through North Africa to the Rafah border and negotiate entrance into the besieged Strip.\nThe Gaza Tribunal’s intended intervention is less direct. The initiative channels a tradition dating back to the Vietnam War, during which intellectuals and activists created the Russell Tribunal on U.S. War Crimes. Since then, people’s tribunals have convened civil society dozens of times to expose and protest atrocities against communities that the law has failed to protect or rendered expendable. Despite their name, these tribunals have no legal authority; they shed the trappings of the courtroom and presume the accused – powerful states – guilty. Organizers hope that this most recent iteration will process the overwhelming evidence from Gaza into a comprehensive historical record that can provide support to other efforts on narrative, political, and legal battlegrounds.\nRichard Falk, president of the Gaza Tribunal, is a professor of law and former UN official on the Occupied Palestinian Territories who attended the first Russell Tribunal in 1967, and has since participated in and led numerous others. “The people’s tribunal seeks action … ranging from pressure on governments to cease supplying weapons and funds and on other parts of society to impose solidarity initiatives,” including Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, Falk said in an interview prior to the tribunal’s meeting in Sarajevo.\nExceptions Are the Rule of Law for Palestine\nBy the time the international law chamber launched the first day of the Gaza Tribunal, the fact of genocide was plain, organizers said: Consensus had already developed among independent mechanisms of the United Nations, academics, experts, and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that Israel is violating the 1948 Genocide Convention; there was no denying 19 months of overwhelming, livestreamed evidence, they said.\nStill, the chamber built its case, testimony laying the framework for analysis of genocide under international law followed by research and witness accounts of genocidal acts. Palestinian journalist Ahmed Abu Artema, in a pre-recorded audio entry from Gaza, described the hell of relentless forced evacuations as Israeli military demarcate neighborhoods for strikes. Thaer Ahmad and Mimi Syed, both physician volunteers who traveled to Gaza from the United States, spoke from the podium about providing medical care amid endless mass casualty incidents, medical supply shortages, and contaminated conditions. First-year university student Senad Bibanovich said their remarks were so appalling he felt ill simply from listening.\nThe Gaza Tribunal was therefore not charging Israel alone with genocide, which South Africa has already done before the International Court of Justice in a case now 17 months underway, in which the court has found it plausible that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention and ordered it in January 2024 to take measures to protect against further abuses in Gaza. Rather, the tribunal intended to spotlight how other states and the inadequacy of the international system have made genocide against Palestinians in Gaza possible.\n“There is a clear problem in current mechanisms of prevention and accountability … because they have allowed for 19 months now these kind of crimes in plain sight to be committed,” said Nimer Sultany, international law scholar at SOAS University of London, author and member of the international law chamber, in an interview between sessions.\nThe task of the Gaza Tribunal is therefore “not related only to Gaza and Palestine exclusively; it’s also about why ‘Never Again’ did not work,” Sultany continued.\nThe diagnosis came with the next chambers, which dealt with the comparative, geopolitical, and historical dimensions of this and other genocides.\nExplaining the abject failure of “Never Again” requires revisiting the beginning of the post-World War II international system, Craig Mokhiber, former director of the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, submitted in a virtual testimony on the tribunal’s second day. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Genocide Convention both came on the heels of the 1947 UN Partition Plan for Palestine. The first two created universal norms of self-determination and freedom from genocide; the other, Mokhiber said, ratified belligerent land theft and ethnic cleansing of the Nakba, the mass displacement of approximately 750,000 Palestinians from their homes between 1947 and 1949.\nThis confounded moment birthed what Mokhiber called “the Israel exception to international law … that has haunted [the UN] for decades, carved out space for genocide and ultimately threatened the very legitimacy and sustainability of the United Nations itself.”\n“Selectivity and politicization of international law — that is the rule,” Palestinian human rights attorney Sourani said in his address.\nMokhiber said that the Israel exception is a symptom of what he called “the fundamental contradiction in international law: There are in fact two UNs.”\nAccording to Mokhiber, the first UN is the one with deference to its own charter and human rights treaties; where colonization, apartheid, and genocide are universally prohibited. The second UN is the one that partitioned Palestine; that, during the three-decade Oslo Accords between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel, “told the Palestinians they must negotiate for their rights with their oppressor” in a process mediated by the United States, “the world’s sole superpower, which also happened to be Israel’s closest ally and arms provider”; the UN that has been “silent on genocide, unable to call for ceasefire or accountability.”\nWhat makes the latter more often the UN in force is the fact that there is no formal method outside the Security Council of enforcing human rights instruments, UN General Assembly resolutions, or International Court of Justice orders — such as its January 2024 provisional measures or its July 2024 opinion finding Israel’s occupation illegal, and requiring that other states not “render aid or assistance” toward maintaining occupation in the Palestinian Territories (a conclusion the United States has criticized as too broad). The Security Council enjoys a range of authorities, including imposing sanctions and military action; but its five permanent state parties — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — have unchecked veto power on any council decision.\n“What then can the UN, its member states and all who support its founding principles do to end a genocide, protect its victims and hold its perpetrators to account when a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council is itself implicated in the perpetration of a genocide and fully committed to its continuation?” Mokhiber asked.\nOn June 4, the United States vetoed a ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, bringing its total number of vetoes with respect to Palestine since October 2023 to six; since 1945, at least, the U.S. has vetoed at least 40.\nThe Tribunal’s Intervention\nThese exceptions and failures, and the disconnect between unprecedented popular solidarity with Palestinians and the continued diplomatic and military support by governments of Israel, demanded a tribunal come together, organizers said.\nThe tribunal form is “really key” for civil society to do what states and international institutions are not: “taking to task the governments who are complicit in these crimes, not relying on the incredibly slow process of the international legal order,” said Penny Green, a professor of law at Queen Mary University of London School of Law, and member of the steering committee who has participated in other tribunals past. “The wheels of international law turn so slowly, and then they are toothless.”\nYet, some have questioned what the tribunal can accomplish when the world has already been saturated daily by the evidence of the horror in Gaza and has still not been able to end an active genocide. Gianni Tognoni, the secretary general of the Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal, the institutional home for over 50 people’s tribunals worldwide, was in attendance. He pointed out in a conversation between panels this dilemma: In other cases, tribunals have served to give visibility to an injustice that has been ignored or covered up. “Here, the opposite: we have visibility in excess,” he said.\nThough the tribunal doesn’t have legal or enforcement power, members anticipated it could serve as a source of mass, credible documentation for others to draw on in organizing political pressure on complicit actors and in future legal efforts toward accountability. Organizers said they are collecting all the material, including members’ oral testimony and reports into a single archive, from the session in Sarajevo and the second in October.\n“This entire tribunal is really a complement to the efforts of Palestinian civil society as a whole that has been ongoing throughout this genocide in particular but for decades,” according to Wesam Ahmad, a human rights advocate at the Palestinian NGO Al-Haq and tribunal steering committee member. His hope is that the repository of the tribunal material could be marshaled in organizing on the ground.\nHow the tribunal specifically plans to support Palestinian and solidarity organizing was not made explicit; but one possible contribution it might make is to future criminal cases and lawsuits against Israel and other actors in formal courts, said Susan Akram, member of the tribunal’s steering committee and co-chair of the international law chamber.\nEven the act of gathering together and naming the crimes can be significant if it’s brought back to people in Gaza, said Akram Lilja, a professor from Gaza and project lead on damage assessment of cultural heritage sites in Gaza, which includes 30 people on the ground. He can now tell his team in Gaza that there are people from Bosnia, New York, California, Turkey, “from every place around the world who know about you…. You are not alone.”\nTo some, the potential of people’s tribunals comes from their ability to source their principles outside international law, with its deep contradictions and inequities, and to act with immediacy, creativity, and moral clarity. Limited thus far to symbolic proclamations and with the Gaza Tribunal’s final judgment not expected until October, it remains to be seen what doing so will look like.\nIn his short address to the membership the day before the Sarajevo Declaration was ratified, Tognoni, the secretary general of the Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal, spoke plainly: The evidence of Israel and the world’s crimes “is so beyond a reasonable doubt it cannot be considered a juridical problem.”\nThe time has come, he asserted, to “stop talking about violations.” Those alive in Gaza “do not have the time to die and die and die” because of delays in “juridical qualification.”\nTognoni requested that the tribunal “have a judgment in real time while [Palestinians] are living and looking to the future. That is the main right of the Palestinian people, to have a future now.”\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support.

Trump clears path for Nippon investment in US Steel, so long as it fits gov't terms\nPresident Donald Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a “national security agreement” submitted by the federal government\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order paving the way for a Nippon Steel investment in U.S. Steel, so long as the Japanese company complies with a “national security agreement” submitted by the federal government.\nTrump's order didn’t detail the terms of the national security agreement.\nBut the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a “ golden share \" — essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.\n“We thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.”\nThe companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.\n“The partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,” the statement said.\nU.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.\nThe companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said the order “ensures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America’s national and economic security.”\nJames Brower, a Morrison Foerster lawyer who represents clients in national security-related matters, said such agreements with the government typically are not disclosed to the public, particularly by the government.\nThey can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company — like U.S. Steel — that is publicly held, Brower said.\nThe mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.\nU.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.\nNippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden’s presidency.\nAs it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace — a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap — that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.\nNippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel’s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.\nIt also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn’t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel’s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.\nTrump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.\nTrump said Thursday that he would as president have “total control” of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.\nTrump said then that the deal would preserve “51% ownership by Americans,” although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.\n“We have a golden share, which I control,” Trump said.\nTrump added that he was “a little concerned” about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, “but that gives you total control.”\nThe proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.\nThe order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided “credible evidence” that Nippon Steel “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” but such risks might be “adequately mitigated” by approving the proposed national security agreement.\nThe order doesn't detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.\nThe order said the draft agreement was submitted to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday. The two companies must successfully execute the agreement as decided by the Treasury Department and other federal agencies that are part CFIUS by the closing date of the transaction.\nTrump reserves the authority to issue further actions regarding the investment as part of the order he signed on Friday.\n___\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

            "NIH scientists publish declaration criticizing Trump's deep cuts in public health research. NIH scientists publish declaration criticizing Trump's deep cuts in public health research\nPresident Donald Trump’s National Institutes of Health director says some employees’ critical letter to him has “fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.”\nWASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. “Dissent,\" he said, ”is the very essence of science.”\nThat commitment is being put to the test.\nOn Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging “policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.”\nIt says: \"We dissent.\"\nIn a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter — and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.\nThe four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a “Gold Standard” of science, not “ideological activism.”\nThe signers went public in the face of a “culture of fear and suppression” they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. “We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,” the declaration says.\nBhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it “has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"\n“Nevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,” he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.”\nNamed for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world’s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.\nIt addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.\nIn one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.\nIn a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. “Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,” it says, “it wastes $4 million.”\nJenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.\nAt the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.\n“I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.\nThe signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya’s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.\nHis declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.\n“He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.\nAs chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone — my work,” she said.\nThe 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator” in the political manipulation of biomedical science.\nIan Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. “We have a saying in basic science,” he said. “You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.\n“We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,” he added. But that won’t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.\nThe NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.\nEmployees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.\nThe letter asserts “NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety” and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who “braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.”\nThe Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.\nAt the White House, Desai said Americans “have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.”\nThis has forced “indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,” the declaration says.\nSome NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.\nThe dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.\nWith that in place, he said in a statement in April, “NIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"\nNow it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.\n“There's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,” said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.\n“Maybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.”\ne and noy on\n“In recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,” spokesman Kush Desai said. “The Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science — not ideological activism — as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.”\n___\nAssociated Press Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.",

Sign up here.\nI’ve been spending my time lately watching footage of the 7.9 earthquake that happened in Myanmar and Thailand in March. There’s one video in particular in which the earth undulates like an ocean wave that’s particularly unforgettable. This YouTube channel has innumerable videos from around the country depicting that same moment — from hotels to homes to hotpot restaurants.\nThe fallacy of a systematic review\nWhenever I see a literature review for a topic I’m writing about, I often think, “Oh, great! I can trust this paper.” Based on reporting from STAT’s Anil Oza, I might need to reevaluate this impulse. A new JAMA Network Open paper adds to a body of evidence that not all systematic reviews are created equal and some researchers are trying out alternatives to these analyses.\nSystematic reviews, which involve pooling data from multiple studies and analyzing them together, are increasingly popular as a way to produce more authoritative conclusions than can be derived from the individual smaller papers. A small number of systematic reviews included retracted studies from paper mills, journals that produce low quality research to help researchers game the academic job market.\nThe problems are not limited to academia, either. In recent weeks, systematic reviews have been used to justify policy around gender affirming care as well as in the MAHA report. Media reports quickly followed in their wake showing that these reports were riddled with errors.

More than 70 top U.S. nutrition scientists signed a letter yesterday demanding that Bhattacharya address censorship at the agency, writing that their colleagues “need the freedom to present their findings in scientific meetings without political oversight, and to author and co-author freely in the scientific literature.”\nThe letter is in part a response to censorship allegations from former NIH nutrition scientist Kevin Hall, whose groundbreaking research on ultra-processed foods was cut short when he quit in April, citing meddling from his superiors. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also recently threatened to bar NIH scientists from publishing in leading journals like JAMA and the Lancet “because they’re all corrupt.” The letter also asks for more investment in nutrition research at the agency, including doubling the current budget to $4 billion.\nThis follows Monday’s letter from hundreds of NIH employees to Bhattacharya, which rebuked everything from the agency’s cancellation of LGBTQ+ research grants to the proposed cuts to support for indirect research costs at universities. In the words of my colleague Anil Oza: “Jay’s inbox is FULL this week.” Read the letter here. – Sarah Todd\nTrump to pharma: lower drug prices *now*\nThe Trump administration is pushing pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily lower drug prices and allow companies to sell their drugs to Americans directly, but executives and industry lobbyists are antsy about taking the next step.\nLower priced drugs were a key part of Trump’s presidential agenda, that Americans would pay no more than the lowest price for drugs paid by peer nations, but the administration’s demands have been short on details since announcing the policy in May. The administration has not yet detailed how it would establish a direct-to-consumer mechanism, though it says that it has given companies price targets for their drugs: the lowest price offered in peer nations.\nIt’s the latest update in a weekslong saga that does not show any sign of ending soon. Will pharma companies voluntarily bend under the administration’s scrutiny?

Instituting these work requirements would only actually affect a tiny fraction of the 4.8 to 6 million adults projected to lose coverage under the policy. This analysis is the latest report to demonstrate that Medicaid cuts could affect more Americans than Republicans suggest.\nWork requirements are important for Republicans who wish to reduce federal spending. The current provision would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over ten years, which amounts to nearly half of all estimated Medicaid savings in the bill, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. My colleague John Wilkerson’s coverage has been excellent on this issue — stay tuned for more.\nWhy RFK Jr.’s approach to the vaccine advisory committee could backfire\nIf Kennedy wants to “clean up the corruption and conflicts” at HHS, he is going about it the wrong way, writes Genevieve P. Kanter, an economist at the University of Southern California.\nKanter studies conflicts of interest at federal agencies. She says that the purpose of advisory committees is to have external experts offer independent advice to the government on technical and scientific issues. Purging vaccine experts may remove members with industry ties, but not without a cost. Studies show that committee members with industry relationships tend to publish more and higher-impact articles, suggesting they can bring more expertise to the table.

            "How Trump’s last-minute contract decision sent brains to the grave. How Trump’s last-minute contract decision sent brains to the grave\nBrain banks stopped taking donations as their contract expiration date approached.\nPresident Donald Trump’s push to cut billions of dollars in government contracts is rattling the niche community of scientists who collect, study and share human brains.\nTwo of the country’s brain banks, which have worked with the government to store and distribute specimens to researchers studying diseases like Parkinson’s and ALS for more than a decade, told POLITICO they had temporarily stopped taking new donations for fear the administration would not renew their contracts. Even though both facilities — home to nearly 8,000 brains between them — eventually received six-month extensions from the National Institutes of Health, the relief came too close to a May 1 deadline.\nThe director of the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank said it turned away as many as 30 brains from people hoping to do something positive with the remains of a loved one who lived with a neurological disease. The Mount Sinai Brain Bank in New York would have accepted roughly 10 more if it had known its contract was being renewed, according to its program director.\nThe funding whiplash demonstrates some of the practical consequences of the Trump administration’s rapid-fire approach to cutting federal spending, where even the potential for funding lapses create real setbacks.\n“Not knowing when, or even if this extension was going to happen, it was very problematic,” said Tom Blanchard, director of Maryland’s brain bank. The window for collecting a brain for research after death is short: just 24 hours, so families of would-be donors had little choice but to give up.\nUnsure whether it’d be able to pay staff after April, Mount Sinai Brain Bank sent layoff notices to its nearly two dozen employees, then revoked them when it learned of the funding extension less than 18 hours before the deadline, said program director Harry Haroutunian.\nIn the month before the contract expiration, the program, which stores 2,640 brains in 43 freezers set at minus 80 degrees Celsius, stopped taking them. Mount Sinai typically takes two brain donations a week.\n“I wasn’t about to accept a donation and then not be in a position to actually characterize the brain and distribute it to our investigators,” Haroutunian said.\nWhen asked to respond to researcher concerns about funding uncertainty, a spokesperson at the Department of Health and Human Services said that leaders at HHS, the parent agency of the National Institutes of Health, maintain continuous communication with NIH leadership to ensure smooth funding. The spokesperson said NIH remains committed to “rigorous, Gold Standard Science.”\nFrustrated donors\nSusan Mojaverian felt heartened by the idea of donating her brother James’ brain to the NIH. She’d discussed the plan with him prior to his death last month. James, who died at 72, was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.\nFurthering research into schizophrenia was important to them. Susan and James participated in an NIH schizophrenia sibling study where they traveled to the agency’s Bethesda, Maryland, campus for days of psychological tests and MRIs.\nResearch on donor brains has helped scientists understand the genetic risk for schizophrenia, shown distinct scarring patterns on the brains of servicemembers who suffered blast injuries and helped identify cells that contribute to developing Down syndrome.\nThrough the NIH’s NeuroBioBank, researchers around the world can search an inventory of thousands of brains across the six repositories, refine their search by diagnosis, age, race, gender and brain region, then order brain tissue by volume, weight or number of brain sections. The NIH manages researcher requests, while the repositories collect and prepare the donor brains, fulfill orders and mail out tissue. All scientists pay is shipping.\nWithout the NIH program, brain donor research would be prohibitively expensive, said Blanchard. A single piece of brain tissue could cost $250 through a commercial lab, he explained, and researchers need to purchase enough samples to produce statistically significant results — plus buy control group samples. Without the federally funded network saving them millions of dollars a year, researching human tissue might be too expensive for some scientists.\nThe loss of the brains at Maryland and Mount Sinai could have consequences for research, he added, pointing to the brains of Parkinson’s patients: “Everybody wants to study the same small region of the brain, the substantia nigra,” Blanchard said, adding, “Even though we have the whole brain, for the Parkinson’s research community, they get exhausted quickly.”\nWhen Mojaverian contacted the director of the NIH’s Human Brain Collection Core by email, he offered his condolences and the Maryland brain bank’s phone number. He added a note in his reply, stressing the importance of James’ donation. “For UMD: the decedent was extensively studied at NIH as a participant with schizophrenia. It would be important to acquire this brain if at all possible.”\nLater that day, Mojaverian approached Maryland about making the donation, and was told it wouldn’t be possible.\nMaryland’s donor portal was clear about the reason why: “Due to the uncertainty of federal funds UMBTB is anticipating a funding gap, that will impact our ability to collect donations. We cannot anticipate how long this funding gap will be.”\nBy the time Maryland learned of its contract extension 16 days later, the window to accept James’ brain had passed.\nMojaverian, who said she’s had a good experience with NIH researchers and doctors over the decades, blamed the Trump administration for her loss.\n“This is the contribution that my brother, who had so much potential in this world and was never able to achieve it because of this severe and persistent mental illness — that he could be making this major contribution to science and somebody else would benefit from it,” she said.\nMembers of Congress, including Republicans, have also complained about the administration’s approach to cost-cutting.\n“Stability is a key aspect of the American formula because it allows scientists to focus their work knowing that they will have the support they need to pursue and test their ideas from start to finish,” Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said during an Appropriations Committee hearing last month.\nVice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) put it more directly. “Trump is committing deliberate sabotage at NIH and creating indefensible uncertainty that is making it impossible for researchers to do their jobs,” Murray told POLITICO.\nA broader problem\nThe ambiguity and eleventh-hour funding decisions at the brain banks are indicative of a larger phenomenon the NIH-funded research ecosystem is grappling with as Trump reconsiders its work.\nAnother program that suffered funding whiplash was the Women’s Health Initiative, an ongoing long-term national women’s health study backed by an NIH institute.\nOn April 21, initiative investigators reported that HHS was terminating the program’s regional center contracts. A few days later, following widespread news coverage, an HHS spokesperson told POLITICO the funding was being restored. It wasn’t until May 5 that contractors received official confirmation.\nWithout timely communication, investigators were left to wonder whether HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s public comments calling the centers’ work “mission critical for women’s health” and the cuts “fake news” meant that HHS would maintain current funding levels, impose some funding reductions or whether nothing had changed and the cuts were still coming.\nHHS said that government procedures and bureaucratic processes held up officially notifying the group of restored funding.\nWhile renewing and restoring research funding have run up against the red tape of government processes and procedures, cuts have come more swiftly, with few signs that bureaucracy is holding them up.\nRegardless of the cause of the notification delay, the uncertainty had a chilling effect. Investigators, especially early career researchers, were reluctant to pitch new projects to the Women’s Health Initiative. Staff worried about losing their jobs. Managers wondered how they’d quickly wind down the 32-year-old project, notify the 42,000 participants and destroy or negotiate transfer of 4 million vials of frozen biospecimens.\nMeanwhile, the administration’s decision to extend the brain bank contracts for six months doesn’t end the banks’ uncertainty. While Blanchard said he’s optimistic in the wake of the renewal, if a month or two passes without word of the next review or funding meeting, his anxiety will return. While the October contract renewal should be for five years, he’s concerned that his funding level could be cut, likely causing him to reduce donations once again or cut staff.\nNIH program officers told Mount Sinai’s Haroutunian that maintaining the program’s resources is an agency priority and that they expect to be able to renew the funding in October, he said. “But that’s guesswork on everybody’s part,” he added."

Eric Trump, President Trump’s son who is running The Trump Organization, said the new venture called Trump Mobile will sell phones that will be built in the U.S., and the phone service will maintain a call center in the country as well. WATCH: As economists warn tariff policies are hammering the dollar, Trump family invests heavily in crypto The announcement of the new mobile phone and service, called T1 Mobile, follows several real estate deals for towers and resorts in the Middle East, including a golf development in Qatar announced in April. A $1.5 billion partnership to build golf courses, hotels and real estate projects in Vietnam was approved last month, though the deal was in the works before Trump was elected. Even oversight of such a company, with the Trump name attached, raises ethical concerns. Trump has already used the federal government to reward his allies and punish his enemies. The Federal Communications Commission, the primary regulatory body overseeing mobile phone companies, has already launched investigations of media outlets Trump dislikes and, in some cases, is personally suing. Eric Trump said Monday that consumers deserve a phone that aligns with their values. “Hard-working Americans deserve a wireless service that’s affordable, reflects their values, and delivers reliable quality they can count on,” he said in a statement. The company would also enter a highly competitive market that includes companies that have been directly attacked by Donald Trump. President Trump criticized Apple last month because it planned to make most of its U.S. iPhones in India, and threatened to slap a 25% tariff on the devices unless the tech giant starts building the phones domestically. The Trump phone deal comes as mandatory financial disclosure reports just filed with the government show the president has moved fast in the last year to profit off his celebrity, taking in $3 million in revenue from selling “Save America” coffee table books, $2.8 million from Trump watches and $2.5 million from Trump branded sneakers and fragrances. The Trump Organization on Monday said the new, gold-colored phone available for $499 in August, called the T1 Phone, won’t be designed or made by Trump Mobile, but by another company. The Trump Organization did not respond immediately to a request for more details. In the first term, Trump was blasted by conservative and liberal government ethics experts alike for opening his Washington hotel to lobbyist and diplomats and violating his company’s pledge to avoid even the appearance of a conflict between his private profit and the public interest. The company is feeling more emboldened now in the second term. The mobile service is partnering with existing cellular carriers with access to a 5G network, raising questions of how they will be treated by federal regulators now they have partnered with his company in a venture. The Trump Organization said those companies are America’s three biggest mobile network providers, an apparent reference Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, the latter with a trademarked name that is very similar to Trump’s T1 Mobile. The name given to the monthly service offer, The 47 Plan, and the monthly fee of $47.45 a month makes reference to Trump’s two terms, the 45th president and the 47th. The service will include unlimited calls, texts and data and free roadside assistance and telehealth services. A mock-up of the planned phone on the company’s website showed Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great” on the front and an etched American flag on the back.

Give Now By — Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Trump family said it is licensing its name to a new mobile phone service, the latest in a string of ventures that have been announced while Donald Trump is in the White House despite ethical concerns that the U.S. president could mold public policy for personal gain. Eric Trump, President Trump’s son who is running The Trump Organization, said the new venture called Trump Mobile will sell phones that will be built in the U.S., and the phone service will maintain a call center in the country as well. WATCH: As economists warn tariff policies are hammering the dollar, Trump family invests heavily in crypto The announcement of the new mobile phone and service, called T1 Mobile, follows several real estate deals for towers and resorts in the Middle East, including a golf development in Qatar announced in April. A $1.5 billion partnership to build golf courses, hotels and real estate projects in Vietnam was approved last month, though the deal was in the works before Trump was elected.

            "Trump's family has a new business venture: a gold-colored $499 smartphone. - Donald Trump's sons unveiled a new Trump Mobile service on Monday.\n- It's the latest way the president and his family are cashing in on their name.\n- Among the new offerings will be a gold-colored, $499 smartphone.\nThe Trump family is getting into the mobile phone business.\nOn the 10th anniversary of President Donald Trump's formal unveiling of his 2016 presidential campaign, his eldest sons made another announcement in Trump Tower: a Trump-branded mobile phone service, including a gold-colored smartphone that is set to be available later this fall.\n\"We've partnered with some of the greatest people in the industry to make sure real Americans can get true value from their mobile carriers,\" Donald Trump Jr. said Monday morning at the press conference.\nThe new venture is the latest example of how Trump and his family are finding new ways to cash in while Trump serves his second term. The Trump Organization touted Monday's unveiling as a \"major announcement.\"\nLike many of the Trump-related business ventures, Trump Mobile has a licensing agreement that allows it to use the president's name.\nAccording to its website, Trump Mobile will offer a \"47 plan,\" which includes unlimited talk, texting, and data for $47.45 a month. The first 20GB of data will be at high speed. Trump, of course, is the 47th president and also served as the 45th.\nMost interestingly, Donald Trump Jr. said that the company would manufacture its smartphone in the United States. Apple and other major tech companies have manufactured their phones outside the US due to labor costs. Trump and the White House have threatened to impose tariffs on those companies if they don't bring back more manufacturing to the US.\nThe T1 Phone, according to the site, will cost $499. Interested consumers can preorder the phone now. The website shows that the phone is gold colored throughout and has \"T1\" and an American stamp on the back. The promotional image says, \"Make America Great Again,\" Trump's trademarked political slogan.\nTrump Jr. says the company will offer more than wireless coverage. He also said roadside assistance and telemedicine services will be available."

Organizers of the “No Kings” demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. WATCH: Millions turn out nationwide for ‘No Kings’ protests against Trump administration Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. A previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Photo by Leah Millis/Reuters Officers then fired tear gas and crowd-control projectiles at the large group, sending demonstrators, hot dog vendors and passing pedestrians fleeing through the street. Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order. “It was a total 100% overreaction. We weren’t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,” said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender. Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind “no kings” banners. Atlanta’s 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army’s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president’s birthday. About 200 protesters assembled in northwest Washington’s Logan Circle and chanted “Trump must go now” before erupting in cheers. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump — a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet — was wheeled through the crowd.

Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday. In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving. The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. “Today, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don’t do kings,” the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended. “So what do you say, Philly?” Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. “Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?” People participate in the “No Kings” protest against President Donald Trump’s policies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 14, 2025.

In Los Angeles, thousands gathered in front of City Hall, hundreds gathered on the lawn in front of Mississippi’s state Capitol and marchers in downtown Little Rock walked across a bridge over the Arkansas River. Protests were planned in nearly 2,000 locations across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening.

The 50501 Movement orchestrating the protests says it picked the “No Kings” name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. Philadelphia Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis.” Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support. “I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration’s layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said.

Téllez, an immigrant from Bolivia who attended the protest. “I’ve enjoyed great success here in the United States, and I’ve also contributed heavily to my community. And if there was space for me, I think there’s a way for everybody else to belong here as well.” Los Angeles Thousands gathered in front of City Hall, waving signs and listening to a Native American drum circle before marching through the streets. As protesters passed National Guard troops or U.S. Marines stationed at various buildings, most interactions were friendly, with demonstrators giving fist bumps or posing for selfies. But others chanted “shame” or “go home” at the troops. Amid signs reading “They fear us don’t back down California” and “We carry dreams not danger, ” one demonstrator carried a 2-foot-tall (60-centimeter) Trump pinata on a stick, with a crown on his head and sombrero hanging off his back. Another hoisted a huge helium-filled orange baby balloon with blond hair styled like Trump’s.

Photo by Daniel Cole/Reuters A few blocks from City Hall, protesters gathered in front of the downtown federal detention center being guarded by a line of Marines and other law enforcement. It was the first time that the Marines, in combat gear and holding rifles, have appeared at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property. Peter Varadi, 54, said he voted for Trump last November for “economic reasons.” Now, for the first time in his life, he is protesting, waving a Mexican and U.S. combined flag. “I voted for Donald Trump, and now I regret that, because he’s taken this fascism to a new level,” Varadi said. “It’s Latinos now. Who’s next? It’s gays. Blacks after that. They’re coming for everybody.” Even after the formal event ended, the downtown streets were packed with a jubilant crowd as people danced to salsa music and snacked on hot dogs and ice cream bought from vendors, many of whom are Latino immigrants. But the previously calm demonstration turned confrontational as police on horseback moved into the crowd and struck some people with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building. New York City Marchers in the crowd that stretched for blocks along Fifth Avenue had diverse reasons for coming, including anger over Trump’s immigration policies, support for the Palestinian people and outrage over what they said was an erosion of free speech rights. But there were patriotic symbols, too. Leah Griswold, 32, and Amber Laree, 59, who marched in suffragette white dresses, brought 250 American flags to hand out to people in the crowd. Demonstrators hold signs and a banner as they march on the streets during the “No Kings” protest against President Donald Trump’s policies, in New York City, June 14, 2025.

Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums. “We’re here because we’re worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and law enforcement encouraged people not to attend rallies “out of an abundance of caution” following the shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers. Dozen of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event. WATCH: Minnesota Gov. Walz holds briefing on shootings of two state lawmakers and their spouses Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets. Seda Heng, 29, of Rochester, said she was heartbroken by the shootings, but still wanted to join the rally there. “These people are trying to do what they can for their communities, for the state, for the nation,” Heng told the Minnesota Star-Tribune. North Carolina Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte’s First Ward Park before marching, chanting “No kings. No crowns. We will not bow down.” Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way. Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to “speak for what’s right” after mass deportations and Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. “If we don’t stop it now, it’s just going to keep getting worse,” she said. Naomi Mena said she traveled an hour to demonstrate in Charlotte to represent her “friends and family who sadly can’t have a voice out in public now” to stay safe. Texas A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a “credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend. Dozens of state troopers swarmed through the grounds about four hours before the event, but the area was later opened and the rally started on time. The building remained closed. The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody “in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers” after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. State police did not detail the threat or immediately identify the person, but said there was no additional active threat.

Some people wore tinfoil crowns atop their heads. Others held signs inviting motorists to “Honk if you never text war plans.” Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because “we are losing the thread of democracy in our country.” Associated Press journalists across the country contributed to this report.

Some protesters held signs denouncing Trump while others banged drums. “We’re here because we’re worried about the existential crisis of this country and the planet and our species,” said Sean Kryston, 28. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and law enforcement encouraged people not to attend rallies “out of an abundance of caution” following the shootings of the Democratic state lawmakers. Dozen of events were canceled, but tens of thousands still turned out for demonstrations in Duluth, Rochester and St. Paul, which included a march to the state Capitol. Walz canceled his scheduled appearance at the St. Paul event. WATCH: Minnesota Gov. Walz holds briefing on shootings of two state lawmakers and their spouses Authorities said the suspect had “No Kings” flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets. Seda Heng, 29, of Rochester, said she was heartbroken by the shootings, but still wanted to join the rally there. “These people are trying to do what they can for their communities, for the state, for the nation,” Heng told the Minnesota Star-Tribune. North Carolina Crowds cheered anti-Trump speakers in Charlotte’s First Ward Park before marching, chanting “No kings. No crowns. We will not bow down.” Marchers stretched for blocks, led by a group of people holding a giant Mexican flag and bystanders cheering and clapping along the way. Jocelyn Abarca, a 21-year-old college student, said the protest was a chance to “speak for what’s right” after mass deportations and Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. “If we don’t stop it now, it’s just going to keep getting worse,” she said. Naomi Mena said she traveled an hour to demonstrate in Charlotte to represent her “friends and family who sadly can’t have a voice out in public now” to stay safe. Texas A rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin went off as planned despite state police briefly shutting down the building and the surrounding grounds after authorities said they received a “credible threat” to Democratic state lawmakers who were to attend. Dozens of state troopers swarmed through the grounds about four hours before the event, but the area was later opened and the rally started on time. The building remained closed. The Department of Public Safety later said one person was taken into custody “in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers” after a traffic stop in La Grange, Texas, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Austin. State police did not detail the threat or immediately identify the person, but said there was no additional active threat.

Some people wore tinfoil crowns atop their heads. Others held signs inviting motorists to “Honk if you never text war plans.” Melissa Johnson said she drove an hour-and-a-half to Jackson to protest because “we are losing the thread of democracy in our country.” Associated Press journalists across the country contributed to this report.

You.”\nThe King family has been outspoken against Trump and his policies. Trump’s inauguration in January coincided with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, leading the civil rights icon’s children, including King III, to encourage the president to do more to unite the country.\n“If you said you wanted to be a uniter, then those who didn’t support you, you need to reach out to them or allow them to reach out to you,” King III said during an interview on “Meet the Press” ahead of the inauguration. “We’re not reflective of the ‘United’ States of America right this moment, in my judgment.”\nProtesters arrive outside the White House\nReporting from Washington\n“Refuse Fascism” protesters arrive at Lafayette Park, next to the White House.\nHundreds attend protest in Brooklyn despite rainy weather\nDespite the rainy weather, hundreds of people showed up to Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn on Saturday afternoon to protest against a number of the Trump administration’s policies.\nHolding umbrellas and protest signs, people railed against issues from cuts to Medicare and Social Security, to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Folk singers performed at the rally and several people spoke in front of the crowd, including Brooklyn borough president Antonio Reynoso.\nCarol Sanjour, a Brooklyn-based psychologist who helped organize the protest, said that protesters were primarily united against fascism.\n“We are not fascists and we won’t stand for this, and this is a way to fight back,” Sanjour said.\nThe turnout, Sanjour said, made her proud to be a New Yorker.\n“I grew up in Brooklyn, and that’ll be my home from cradle to grave. And really, what makes this special to me is the diversity,” she said “When I saw these people show up, that’s what America is, to me, this kind of community.”\nProperty tax protesters turn out at Texas Capitol before 'No Kings' protest\nReporting from Austin, Texas\nA few hours before the \"No Kings\" protest is set to start in Austin, Texas, a group of about two dozen people stood beneath shade trees on the state Capitol grounds to urge Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to terminate property taxes. There was no law enforcement attending their protest.\nAaron Sorrells, the head of \"We’re Done\" — the group that is protesting — said the anti-property taxes protest, planned before clashes between officers and demonstrators broke out in Los Angeles, was supposed to be larger. But, he said, many people decided not to come because of the expected crowds much later in the day for the \"No Kings\" protest.\nOne of the protesters, Dustin Orosz, 36, of San Antonio, said that given what has happened in other protests, “it may not be a bad precaution” for Abbott to have deployed the Texas National Guard for the later protest.\n“No one wants to see people getting abused,\" Orosz said. \"People should be allowed to protest ... but they have to do it peacefully.”\nDemonstrators cast Cuomo in same light as Trump at New York’s protests\nReporting from New York City\nThreaded within a disdain for Trump and his immigration policies, some New Yorkers are out on the streets also protesting former New York Gov.

He’s a scumbag. He’s disgraced,” Kayla Kelly, 33, said. “Why not give Zohran Mamdani a chance to actually do something for the people who live here? Andrew Cuomo will just come back and say whatever he needs to, to get back in.”\n'No Kings' protesters gather in Newark, New Jersey\nReporting from Newark, New Jersey\nNewark, New Jersey's \"No Kings\" protest organizers said, despite the rain, more people came out than they anticipated, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J.\n“We need to stand together as a people to realize that this is a democracy and that it’s not for kings. It’s not for one party, it’s about everyone coming together to make America better, but with grace, love and mercy, not this craziness that’s happening in this administration,” protester Christina Orama said.\nLawrence Hamm, the chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress, helped bring several locations together for the event that began in front of the Essex County Historic Courthouse. “We came together today to voice our stern opposition to the policies, the racist and fascist, reactionary policies of the Trump administration, [which] is trying to take this country towards a dictatorship,” Hamm said.\nHamm said that even though the protest was smaller compared to protests in other big cities around the country, the timing was noteworthy.\n“It’s significant here because of recent events, the arrest of Mayor Baraka at Delaney Hall, ICE detention facility, the indictment of Congresswoman McIver, elected officials who were only trying to do their job,” Hamm said, referencing Baraka's arrest in May at an ICE detention center.\nMany of the protesters also spoke about their frustrations with the military parade happening in Washington and their hope that the nationwide protests distract from Trump’s event.\n“They want to show their force, show their might, in order to strike fear and intimidation in the general population. We are not afraid. We are not afraid. We are the children of Dr. King and Malcolm X and so many others who gave their lives. And we’re going to fight. We’re going to fight for every inch of social progress we’ve made over the last 100 years, and we will win,” Hamm said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin: 'We've got no kings here. We've got no queens here. We've got no emperors.'\nReporting from Philadelphia\nThousands of protesters were gathered in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art after marching from Love Park, listening to speakers including politicians, union leaders and the family members of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n“We’ve got no kings here. We’ve got no queens here. We’ve got no emperors,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told the crowd. Raskin then addressed Trump, saying, “You are not our king and we are not your subjects.”\n“We will never be your subjects,” he said, as the crowd cheered.\nRaskin and other speakers also took time to address the shootings of Minnesota lawmakers and condemn political violence.\n“These are our brothers and sisters in the struggle for a more just America, shot down in cold blood in broad daylight,” he said. “We pray for them and all of the people of Minnesota.”\nProtesters march down Fifth Avenue in New York\nReporting from New York City\nA sea of protesters are making their way slowly down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan toward Madison Square Park.

We feel like Republicans have basically tried to take over the American flag and kind of use it as a weapon against other people in the country,” said Stacie Phillips, 59, as she and her husband marched and held a large American flag between them.\n“We wanted to come out because we are consistently seeing Donald Trump and his administration illegally try to use their power in very corrupt and criminal ways,” she said. “We are tired of seeing that, and the best thing we can do is stand up for what we believe in.”\nPhillips said the massive protest stood in contrast to the large military parade Trump will hold later Saturday.\n“I think it very sends a very powerful message, especially today, that we counteract that with something that shows that we are resisting,” she said. At the same time, members of the crowd chanted, “No more fascists, no more Trump!”\nFrancis Cota, 35, who waved a large American flag above his head as he marched, said he and other protesters were “fighting for democracy” and to protect a country that they love.\nCota said the issues most important to him were “human rights and the environment in a big way” as well as democracy and diplomacy.\nHe said that while America has its problems, its democratic values are something, “I think people, especially people my age, often take a lot of those things for granted.”\n“Like, I feel more like we’re the ones here, like, trying to, like, preserve our institutions,” he said.\n'Refuse Fascism' protesters say they want protests to remain non-violent\nReporting from Washington\nSam Goldman, an organizer for the coalition \"Refuse Fascism,\" told NBC they organized in D.C. because it was important that “the capital not be ceded to this fascist regime.” She wore a shirt reading “Trump must go now” — a slogan that organizers frequently led the crowd in chanting.\n“Any time that a tyrant has been deposed, it’s been because the people have planted themselves in the streets and raised that demand,” she said.\nOrganizers told NBC News they want demonstrations to remain nonviolent.\nGoldman said that “when you create a situation where you stop business as usual through your nonviolent but determined resistance, you change what’s possible, and you create the political conditions in which the removal could take place.”\nCounterprotester in Miami wishes Trump a happy birthday\nMiami’s “No Kings” protest was met by a small group of counterprotesters, according to NBC6 in South Florida.\nOne of them was 82-year-old Bob Kunst, who was carrying a sign that said: “Happy birthday President Trump.”\n“Happy Birthday Mr. President. I am a registered Democrat but I am here to support my president. He won,” Kunst said.\nKunst also sported a red hat that read, “Trump Was Right About Everything” and a T-shirt bearing the Israeli flag that said, “Never again is now.”\nMinnesota shooting suspect allegedly had 'No Kings' posters in car\nThe suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers allegedly had “No Kings” posters in his car, the Minnesota State Patrol said in their briefing today.\n‘Refuse Facism’ protesters voice why they’re demonstrating in the nation’s capital\nReporting from Washington\nSunsara Taylor, a spokesperson for \"Refuse Fascism,\" said she is “absolutely thrilled” that people are declaring “No Kings” in cities across the country.\n“But to those who said don’t come to D.C., respectfully, you are wrong. This is where the eyes of the world will be. This is where Donald Trump has issued his fascist threats, and we can’t back down because of that.”\nJustin Tobey, 30, said he showed up to the protest because he feels “we’re seeing this really frightening crackdown on our rights.”\nTobey lives in D.C. but is originally from the L.A. area. He referenced Sen. Padilla being handcuffed and “hardworking immigrants being snatched off the streets, it’s really scary.”\nHe said he wanted to attend the protest in D.C. because it is where he lives and “this is where the, in my view, authoritarians are.”\nJason Denise traveled from Yuma, Arizona, to protest. He said he felt it was important to be “in the lion’s den.”\nHe said he wanted to protest in D.C. because “it’s right here in the heart of what’s going on, and I think there needs to be representation here today too.”\n“I’m hoping to see this movement right here grow,” he said.\nGov. Walz asks people to avoid protests in Minnesota until suspect is apprehended\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked people to avoid protests in his state today until the suspect who shot and killed Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and injured Sen. John Hoffman is in custody.\n\"Out of an abundance of caution my Department of Public Safety is recommending that people do not attend any political rallies today in Minnesota until the suspect is apprehended,\" Walz wrote.\nWalz said the attack \"appears to be a politically motivated assassination\" at a press conference this morning.\nCrowds protest against President Trump in Philadelphia's Love Park\nReporting from Philadelphia\nDemonstrators of all ages filled Philadelphia’s Love Park today for the “No Kings” march, holding up a sea of signs as a light drizzle came down.\nOrganizers expect Philadelphia’s march to be one of the largest in a day of protests across the country.\nThe crowd cheered and chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, this wannabe king has got to go!” And “Love not hate makes America great!”\nThomas Nephew, 67, came from the D.C. area with his wife for the protest, and said he was moved to stand up against Trump's policies.\n“What Trump and his administration have been doing has been outrageous,” he said, denouncing what he called the “kidnapping” of Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia as well as a “general disrespect for due process, a disrespect for Congress.”\nNephew held a sign reading, “We will not be silenced” on one side and “ICE = Thugs” on the other.\n“It’s just going from bad to worse, and nobody seems to be standing up to him,” he said.\n“So, I want to be a part of sending a signal that we’re watching, we’re not happy with how things are going and we’re going to stand up and fight back.”\n'No Kings' event in northeast Minneapolis canceled following shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers\nThe “No Kings” protest in northeast Minneapolis has been canceled following the shooting of two state lawmakers, according to the organizers’ website.\n“The No Kings event in Northeast Minneapolis has been canceled due to a shelter-in-place order following a politically motivated shooting of two elected officials,\" a banner on the website reads. \"We are monitoring the situation closely and urge everyone in the area to follow all local safety guidance.\"\nSeparately, the Minnesota State Patrol on social media asked the public to refrain from attending the planned demonstrations across the state \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\nProtesters wear costumes, hold handmade signs\nSome demonstrators are taking to the streets in costumes and holding signs to help deliver their messages of protest.\nAs reported by NBC Washington, protesters in Washington, D.C., are wearing taco costumes, an apparent reference to the acronym “TACO” — meaning Trump Always Chickens Out — first used by a Financial Times columnist describing Trump’s changing stances on tariffs.\nMeanwhile in Philadelphia, the birthplace of the United States, a crowd carrying signs reading “No Kings” has gathered at Love Park, NBC10 Philadelphia reports.\nCivil rights icon Dolores Huerta tells demonstrators to remain nonviolent as they protest Trump policies\nLabor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta shared her advice with demonstrators ahead of the nationwide “No Kings” protests, telling them to remain nonviolent.\nIn an interview with NBC News yesterday, the co-founder of the United Farm Workers said, “We know that this is a way that we will win eventually, and if there is violence … that really opens the door for provocateurs to come in, people that are on the other side that will come in and do some type of violent acts just to kind of justify the type of brutal police force that we have seen,” she added.\nHuerta, who successfully organized farm workers to unionize during the Civil Rights movement, added that nonviolence — along with boycotts — was how that movement became successful.\nShe added that people must also gear up for the 2026 elections, saying, “this is a chance that we will have to take our Congress back and stop some of these destructive policies that the Trump administration is bringing down on our country.”\nHuerta shared her thoughts about immigration, and compared modern immigration enforcement to 1950s-era deportations, saying that the scenes today are more “brutal” than those of that moment.\n“This is a huge challenge and a test for our democracy, and now we have to see what, how many of us are going to get involved and what are we going to do to save our democracy. Because, at this point in time, if we do not save our democracy, nobody’s going to save it for us,” Huerta said.\nDozens arrested by U.S. Capitol Police at demonstration ahead of military parade\nReporting from Washington\nThe United States Capitol Police said more than 50 people were arrested yesterday at a mostly peaceful demonstration in front of the Supreme Court building.\nAccording to police, officers began establishing a perimeter \"as a precaution\" after about 60 people involved in the demonstration left the Supreme Court.\n\"A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps. Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests,\" the spokesperson said, adding that about 75 people participated in the demonstration.\nThe Supreme Court building is across the street from the steps that lead into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.\nCapitol Police said the roughly 60 demonstrators arrested will be charged with unlawful demonstration and crossing a police line, with some facing additional charges of assault on a police officer and resisting arrest.\nNumerous military veterans participated in the demonstration.\nThe arrests come after Trump promised this week that anyone who protests at the military parade will be met with \"very heavy force.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"the president supports peaceful protests.\"\nNationwide protests loom over Trump’s upcoming military parade\nPresident Trump is getting the parade he wanted showcasing America’s military power — but he’ll also be getting mass protests exposing the nation’s partisan divisions.\nThe tanks and artillery launchers rolling through Washington today will honor the Army’s 250th anniversary, which falls on the day Trump turns 79.\nAbout 7,000 soldiers will march. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line up along Constitution Avenue on the co-birthdays and cheer. Trump is set to watch the spectacle from a viewing stand south of the White House.\nBut in Washington and in all 50 states, organizers will be staging protests that could dwarf the parade in size. A coalition of pro-democracy, labor and liberal activists is arranging a full day of counterprogramming to make the case that Trump is hijacking the Army celebration to venerate himself.\nHere's where the Army's birthday bash will take place\nThe military parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Army is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET and is expected to last for more than an hour. The parade route will take place along the National Mall down Constitution Avenue NW, between 15th and 23rd streets.\nThe event will also include a festival that kicks off at 11 a.m. ET, and the Army says that the parade will conclude with fireworks and a concert. Trump is expected to deliver remarks later in the day too.",

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt / Oregon Capital Chronicle)\nWith the nation’s capital hosting multimillion-dollar celebrations and a parade marking the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and President Donald Trump’s birthday Saturday, huge No Kings demonstrations blanketed the country from coast to coast to protest the president’s actions that have left thousands without jobs and diminished government services.\nMac Farish, who was visiting Topeka, Kansas, from Portland, Oregon, said she felt joy to see hundreds of people attend a No Kings rally in a red state.\n“A lot of people here might be lifelong Republicans, but we’re standing here together because there is a line where tyranny shows up,” Farish said.\nProtesters rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country as of mid-afternoon, according to No Kings national organizers, with 600 more events scheduled.\nIn Arizona, Phoenix resident Cindy Mendoza, 31, came to the Tempe rally with the colors of the Mexican flag painted on her face. She said that her family’s legal status in the country is mixed.\n“We’re here to speak for those who can’t speak,” she said. “We love America. We love your people.”\nMendoza said that the recent immigration raids have created fear in her community.\n“Some friends in construction … they went to the gas station and they got picked up,” Mendoza said. “They were up early heading to work, they stopped by the gas station to get gas and water, and they were taken.”\nRepeated bursts of drenching rain Saturday didn’t deter thousands of Hoosiers amassing at the Indiana Statehouse.\n“Our immigrants are not getting their due process and people are being snatched out of their schools and workplaces. We’re worried that equality is not (getting) attention too,” said Rhonda Clair. “We just want people to be treated with dignity and respect and we’re not seeing that.”\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen issued a state of emergency and activated the National Guard ahead of No Kings events, citing the reaction to recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.\nStill, around 2,000 people turned out in Lincoln, Nebraska, for a peaceful protest, and at least 11 other cities were part of the demonstrations statewide.\nTrenton Morales, 17, said he came out to protest against the workplace immigration raid in Omaha this week and other similar raids nationally.\n“My grandpa recently got deported,” Morales said. “That’s one reason why I’m out here.”\nE.J. Martinez Elementary teacher Jennifer Lopez carried a sign in Santa Fe, New Mexico, that read, “I’m here for my students who are living in fear.”\n“It’s not only about immigration,” she said. “It’s also trans students; students who have gay parents. It’s all women. We’ve had families who are worried about bringing their kids to school when this all started. We’ll see what it’s like when the school year starts again. I’ve had kids who have had a lot of anxiety about the rights for trans kids being taken away.”\nWhat does she tell them?\n“We just have to have hope and to fight,” she said.\nIn Colorado, Emily Baxter, a 23-year-old Boulder resident, said she also joined the Denver protest to object to the Trump administration’s extreme immigration enforcement actions.\n“I am very, very mad about all of the people being taken off of the street and those who are going to work and not coming home and the children who are losing their parents and losing their livelihood,” Baxter said.\nThe protest comes after multiple demonstrations in Denver against deportation efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a march to an ICE detention center in Aurora on Monday and a large gathering at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. Law enforcement deployed smoke and pepper balls against a group of protesters that marched near the interchange of Broadway and Interstate 25 on Tuesday and made 18 arrests related to the demonstration.\nThousands rallied peacefully in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, along with at least 18 communities across the state. Community advocates gave speeches calling to protect democracy, equal rights and due process, followed by a march a few blocks to the Park Strip where a Juneteenth celebration was kicking off.\nTessa Gonzalez, a pediatrician, attended the demonstration of thousands at the Statehouse grounds in Columbia, South Carolina. Her 8-year-old daughter and potential cuts to Medicaid moved her family to join the rally. The child has a rare genetic mutation and requires a specialized wheelchair.\n“My daughter, 100% depends on Medicaid to provide the medicine, equipment — everything that she needs to lead a happy, healthy life,” Gonzalez said. “So it’s essential.”\nProtesters in Georgia evoked the name of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. during a rally near the Gold Dome in Atlanta with signs that read, “Our only king is MLK Jr.!!!”\nAnna Yousaf, an infectious disease doctor who works with vaccines at the CDC, told the Georgia Recorder she came out to oppose Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who she said is undermining public trust in vaccines to deadly effect.\n“Disinformation used to be coming from non-governmental sources,” she said. “Now, RFK Jr. is hijacking political organizations like the CDC, like the FDA, and using our name brand, if you will, to spread disinformation. And so people who would ordinarily go to a CDC resource for trusted information, now they’re going to get disinformation from the health secretary of the United States.”\n“If he succeeds in his crusade to undermine vaccine confidence and restrict access, we will see thousands of people die, mostly children,” she added.\nMassive crowds crossed the Broadway Street bridge in Little Rock, Arkansas, where 15 demonstrations were expected across the state.\n“June 14, Flag Day, is when President Donald Trump is holding a military parade in the nation’s capital, wasting tens of millions of taxpayer dollars as a birthday gift to himself while his administration defies checks on his power, undermines our civil rights and tries to strip away essential benefits from veterans, seniors, hungry children and others,” Indivisible NWA, the organizers of the No Kings protest in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said in a press release.\nThe No Kings protests top off a week of mostly nonviolent demonstrations building around the country in response to ICE raids and in solidarity with Los Angeles, where Trump sent troops in defiance of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, was forcibly removed and handcuffed by federal authorities Thursday during Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in Los Angeles. Thousands gathered across the city for demonstrations opposing ICE and Trump policies anyway.\nIn Maine, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree attended a rally in York, handing out red roses to marchers. “People are angry. They want to know what to do, want to do something. They want to fight back,” she said.\nCraig Carscallen from Lyman, Maine, said, “I hope it influences our elected officials, if they want to get reelected.”\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted one message on social media Saturday, not mentioning the crowd outside his office but rather Army anniversary. “As Americans, we carry the sacred duty to remember, to reflect, and to protect the freedoms that generations of our countrymen have fought to secure.”\nNikki Fried, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, appeared in Tallahassee and posted video comments on social media. “I’m standing on the Old Capitol steps as hundreds and hundreds of Americans are here showing up today to tell Donald Trump, ‘No Kings in America.’ We’re going to fight for our Constitution, fight for our democracy,” she said.\nSaturday’s protests coincided with the 250th anniversary of the Army. A military parade marked the occasion in D.C., where critics have blasted the parade’s cost and optics as Congress weighs the budget reconciliation package that proposes massive cuts to safety net programs.\nEarlier this week, Trump said that protests at the Army parade “will be met with very heavy force.”\nThe U.S. Capitol Police told States Newsroom that protesters were arrested outside the Capitol late Friday after they pushed down bike rack barriers around the building and began running for the Rotunda steps. Veterans for Peace, a group that organized the demonstration, posted photos of the arrests on social media and of several demonstrators wearing “Veterans Against Fascists” t-shirts. Among those arrested was an elderly Vietnam veteran using a walker, Capitol Police confirmed.\nNiki Kelly and Whitney Downard of Indiana Capital Chronicle, Ainsley Platt of Arkansas Advocate, Sara Wilson of Colorado Newsline, Corrine Smith of Alaska Beacon, Julia Goldberg of Source New Mexico, Sherman Smith of Kansas Reflector, Ross Williams of Georgia Recorder, Cassandra Stephenson of Tennessee Lookout, Juan Salinas of Nebraska Examiner, Michael Moline of Florida Phoenix, Jessica Holdman of South Carolina Daily Gazette, Jerod MacDonald-Avoy, Gloria Rebecca Gomez and Emily Holshouser of Arizona Mirror, and Jane Norman of States Newsroom’s D.C.

            "Government home loans: Definition, types, and requirements. Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nGovernment home loans are instrumental in making homeownership affordable for Americans. By encouraging mortgage lenders to broaden service to households of modest means, more first-time home buyers can get into a house, make necessary repairs, and refinance when the time is right.\nHowever, there can be downsides to government loans too.\nHere is a comprehensive digest of the types of government home loans — and what you need to know.\nDig deeper: Types of mortgage loans\nIn this article:\nWhat are government home loans?\nGovernment home loans are insured by the federal government. That financial backing encourages lenders to extend loans to borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for a mortgage.\nGovernment-backed mortgages typically have more relaxed credit standards than conventional loans and are intended to assist first-time, low- to moderate-income, military-related, and rural home buyers.\nPrivate lenders make government loans that generally follow the credit criteria required for each type of loan. However, in some instances, they can add additional qualifying standards, such as a minimum credit score.\nNot to confuse the matter, but in reality, most home loans have some kind of government connection. Even conventional loans are facilitated by government-authorized companies (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that provide financial resources to support mortgage markets. Only mortgages issued for higher-priced homes, called jumbo loans, usually have no government backing and are issued from lenders' own assets.\nTypes of government home loans\nGovernment home loans generally fall into three categories:\n-\nFHA mortgages\n-\nVA loans\n-\nUSDA loans\nHowever, the variations run deep for all the different types of borrowers and situations served by government home loan programs.\nFHA loans\nMortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are called FHA loans. They generally offer down payments as low as 3.5% but are saddled with mortgage insurance premiums.\nLearn more: Understanding FHA mortgage insurance\nFHA home purchase 203(b) loan\nThe 203(b) loan is the primary purchase and refinance lending tool and the foundation of the FHA mortgage program. It’s probably what you think of when you hear the term “FHA loan.” It can finance a single-family home or units of up to four units.\nFHA adjustable-rate mortgage\nWhile FHA loans usually have fixed interest rates that never change, they can also be adjustable-rate mortgages. Your loan begins with an initial interest rate and then periodically changes — up or down — based on an interest rate index. It can be a useful loan option to consider when interest rates are expected to move lower over time.\nFHA condominium mortgage\nCondo lending is also available through an FHA-backed mortgage. Thing is, the condo has to be approved by the FHA. You can search condominiums in your area to see which ones qualify or seek approval for just the unit you want to buy.\nFHA Manufactured Home Loan (Title I)\nNew and used manufactured housing can also qualify for an FHA loan. You can apply through an FHA-approved lender, and some manufactured home dealers also work with lenders through the loan process. You can also apply for an FHA loan to buy the lot where you want to place the home.\nFHA Streamline Refinance\nWhen you want to exchange your existing FHA home loan for one with a lower interest rate, the FHA Streamline Refinance is the way to go. It requires less paperwork and offers quicker approval.\nFHA cash-out refinance\nAn FHA cash-out refinance allows you to access some of your home's equity by replacing your loan, taking a lump sum of cash from the value of your house, and adding that amount back into a new FHA loan's balance.\nFHA Energy Efficient Mortgage Program\nImproving your home's energy efficiency can help you save money on utility bills. The FHA EEM program can help you finance weatherization improvements and even solar and wind installations. A home energy assessment will determine the most cost-effective improvements.\nFHA Rehabilitation Mortgage Standard 203(k)\nIf you want to make extensive home improvements, the FHA 203(k) allows you to finance your project. This can be for a home you own or are buying. It's often used to repair structural issues or for additions and major upgrades.\nFHA Rehabilitation Mortgage Limited 203(k)\nLimited 203(k) loans are usually appropriate for home improvements that are less significant than those of the Standard Rehabilitation Mortgage. They're good options when you need to fund remodeling, painting, and other upgrades to improve a home or prepare it for sale.\nDig deeper: How FHA 203(k) loans work\nFHA Disaster Victims Mortgage 203(h)\nA unique mortgage among the FHA loan roster is the 203(h) for low- and moderate-income victims of major disasters. The loan offers 100% financing to rebuild or buy another home for those whose houses have been destroyed or heavily damaged in a Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Area.\nFHA Hawaiian Home Lands Mortgage\nFHA loans for Native Hawaiians allow the purchase of single-family or up to four-unit homes on Hawaiian homelands. The program addresses the need to lend to borrowers whose houses are built on leased land granted by the Department of Hawaiian Homelands.\nFHA Indian Reservations and Other Restricted Lands (248) Mortgage\nFor homes on tribal land, the Section 248 loan program works with reservation leadership to meet loan requirements. The FHA will then finance a home that adheres to FHA property standards.\nRead more: Best FHA lenders\nVA loans\nLoans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs are a valuable benefit for borrowers with a military connection. VA mortgages are available to active-duty service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses. Best of all, a VA home loan typically requires no down payment.\nVA home purchase loan\nVA purchase loans require a Certificate of Eligibility (COE), and the borrower can qualify under some very generous credit standards. The loan program does not require mortgage insurance but does charge an up-front VA funding fee. The purchase loan can be used to buy or build a single-family home, a four-unit property, a (VA-approved) condominium, or a manufactured home and lot. It can also finance the purchase of a house and fund some improvements at the same time, including energy-efficient upgrades.\nDig deeper: Funding fee exemption — How it works and who qualifies\nVA cash-out refinance loan\nThe same relaxed qualifying standards apply to cash-out refis too. The VA version of the home equity tapping refinance is the same as civilian-available loans — the cash you take out can be used for any purpose. You can also use a VA cash-out refinance to refi a non-VA loan into a new VA loan.\nVA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL)\nYou can reduce the interest rate of an existing VA loan — or replace a VA ARM with a fixed-rate loan — by applying for a VA streamline refinance (VA IRRRL). There are closing costs to pay, so you'll want to determine how long it will take before you break even on what you spend to get a lower-rate loan.\nVA Native American Direct Loan (NADL)\nThis VA loan is for military-connected borrowers who are Native American or have a spouse who is Native American looking to buy, build, or remodel a house on tribal trust land.\nLearn more: Best VA loan lenders\nUSDA loans\nHome loans backed or issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture might make you think you must be a farmer, rancher, or rural resident. And it's true, USDA loans are for borrowers just like that. However, they are also available on properties in some suburban areas.\nUSDA loans with no down payments in eligible areas are particularly suited for modest-income households.\nUSDA Section 502 Guaranteed Loan Program\nThe primary loan program of the USDA is a guaranteed loan is issued by an approved private lender to low-to-moderate-income households. Income limits apply.\nUSDA Section 502 Direct Loan Program\nUnlike the FHA and VA, the USDA offers some loans directly to borrowers through local offices. The Direct Loan Program helps low- and very-low-income households buy \"decent, safe, and sanitary housing,\" the USDA states on its website. Loan proceeds can be used to purchase, build, repair, renovate, or even relocate a home.\nUSDA Section 504 Home Repair program\nHomeowners may obtain financing — or free grants — to repair or improve a home, or to make it safer. Loans have a fixed interest rate of 1%, and grants are available for up to $10,000. The program is for very-low-income households in eligible rural areas.\nUSDA Home Repair Loans & Grants in Presidentially Declared Disasters Pilot program\nFinancially at-risk households may also obtain help during declared disasters with USDA loans and grants. The fund amounts vary each year, but the program is available year-round. However, because it is a pilot program subject to congressional funding, qualifying terms and application deadlines can vary. Consult a local USDA office for more information.\nLearn more: Best USDA loan lenders\nRead more:\nGovernment home loans for senior citizens\nThere is one government home loan designed specifically for borrowers age 62 or older. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), best known as a reverse mortgage, allows homeowners to access the equity in their homes for additional income without moving out of the house. You have several options for receiving your income, including fixed monthly payments, a line of credit, and more.\nWhile the homeowners are drawing the value out of the house, they can remain in the home as long as taxes and insurance remain current.\nHECMs are available from FHA-approved lenders. While HECMs are common, you may be able to find a reverse mortgage through private lenders that the FHA does not insure.\nGovernment home loans FAQs\nCan you have two government loans at the same time?\nIf you are looking to have, for example, an FHA loan and a USDA loan at the same time, you will have to choose. Government-backed loan programs typically limit a borrower to one program at a time.\nAre there government grants to help single parents buy a home?\nGrants can be available from government programs, including state and local assistance programs. Consult a housing counseling agency in your area to see what options are available where you live.\nCan you flip a house purchased with a government-backed loan?\nThe USDA has no rules about buying, improving, and quickly selling a home — a transaction called “house flipping.” Neither do VA-backed loans. FHA rules say you must own a home for more than 90 days before flipping it.\nCan you buy a foreclosed house that was financed with a government mortgage?\nYou can. Homes that were financed with a government-backed loan where the owner couldn't make the payments may be foreclosed on by the lender. So-called \"HUD homes\" are offered for sale on a government website.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley",
            "How to remove FHA mortgage insurance and lower your payments. Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIf you were a first-time home buyer, had less-than-ideal credit, or owed a lot of debt while home shopping, then you may have chosen an FHA loan rather than a regular conventional mortgage.\nBut while this type of mortgage — insured by the Federal Housing Administration — can make buying a home easier for many Americans, it also comes with a major drawback: FHA mortgage insurance premiums.\nThis insurance not only increases the up-front closing costs of your loan, but it also comes with an annual fee that’s spread across the year, increasing your monthly payments as a result. It can also be impossible to remove — but it is possible in some cases.\nAre you tired of paying for MIP on your FHA mortgage loan? Here’s everything you need to know about removing FHA mortgage insurance, including when doing so might be a good idea.\nIn this article:\nWhat is FHA mortgage insurance?\nAn FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is a type of mortgage insurance that is required on FHA loans. Like other forms of mortgage insurance, it is designed to protect FHA-approved lenders against losses if you fail to make your monthly payments. (Essentially, if you default on your loan, your mortgage insurance will repay your lender for a portion of the money it lost.)\nThe benefit of FHA mortgage insurance is that it lessens the risk FHA lenders take on with borrowers. This often allows them to take on borrowers with less-than-perfect credit scores or smaller down payments than other loan programs are able to accept.\nFHA mortgage insurance premiums come in two forms: an up-front premium, which is paid at closing, and annual premiums, which you’ll pay as part of your monthly mortgage payment. The cost of each is laid out below:\n-\nUp-front MIP: 1.75% of your total loan amount\n-\nAnnual MIP: Varies from 0.45% to 1.05% of the loan amount, depending on the term, size, and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of your home loan\nIn most cases, FHA mortgage insurance lasts for the life of the loan. But if you make a down payment of 10% or more, it may only last for 11 years.\nStep-by-step guide on how to remove FHA mortgage insurance\nPaying the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance is one of the biggest drawbacks for homeowners with FHA loans. If you’re eager to remove the extra burden, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\n1. Check your eligibility\nYou might qualify to eliminate your FHA mortgage insurance premium automatically and without refinancing.\nThis is possible if one of these two scenarios applies to you:\nYour loan origination date was between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 2, 2013. In this case, your MIP will be canceled when you reach a loan-to-value ratio of 78% or have 22% equity in your home.\nYour loan origination date was June 3, 2013, or later, and you made a down payment of at least 10%. In this case, your MIP will be canceled after 11 years. (For down payments of less than 10%, you’ll pay mortgage insurance for the life of the loan unless you refinance.)\n2. Refinance your loan\nIf you don’t meet the requirements for automatic MIP removal after reaching 11 years or 22% equity, then you’ll need to refinance your FHA loan to get rid of mortgage insurance.\nYou can do this using several loan types, including a conventional loan, a USDA loan, or a VA loan, though the latter two are reserved for specific borrower types (USDA loans are only for borrowers in rural parts of the country, while VA loans are just for veterans and military members). For most people, refinancing from an FHA loan into a conventional loan will be the most suitable choice.\nTo qualify for a conventional loan with most mortgage lenders, you’ll typically need a 620 credit score and a debt-to-income ratio of 45% or less. You will also need at least 20% equity in your home (anything less than this typically requires its own type of mortgage insurance called private mortgage insurance, or PMI).\n3. Talk to your lender\nIf you can't qualify for MIP cancellation or refinancing and are struggling to keep up with your FHA mortgage payments, contact your lender. They can discuss potential solutions with you. This might include modifying your loan, which allows you to change the terms of your loan without refinancing, or you might be able to put your mortgage loan in forbearance. This gives you a temporary pause or reduction on payments while you get back on your feet.\nIn some cases, you might also be able to explore an FHA Streamline Refinance, which lets you refinance into a new FHA loan. Since this new loan would likely have a lower balance than your first one, it may qualify you for a lower MIP rate, which could reduce your monthly payment as well.\nHow much does FHA MIP cost?\nWhen you take out an FHA loan, you must pay an up-front mortgage insurance premium worth 1.75% of the original mortgage principal at closing, plus an annual MIP, which is divided out among your monthly mortgage payments. The cost of your annual MIP will vary depending on your mortgage size, term length, and loan-to-value ratio.\nLet’s say you borrow $150,000 to purchase your home. In this case, you’ll pay an up-front mortgage insurance premium of $2,625 at closing and annual MIPs of anywhere from 0.45% to 1.05% of the total mortgage — so, around $675 to $1,575 each year (or $56 to $131 per month).\nWhat happens after removing your FHA mortgage insurance?\nThe most noticeable impact of removing your FHA mortgage insurance is that you’ll have a lower monthly mortgage payment. With this extra room in your budget, you could put more cash toward an emergency fund or start beefing up your retirement savings. You could also put those savings back into your home, aggressively paying down the principal on your mortgage, or use it to pay for home improvements that increase your home’s value.\nShould you eliminate FHA mortgage insurance from your loan?\nIn two scenarios, you can automatically eliminate FHA mortgage insurance from your loan (see eligibility criteria above). If you fit into those parameters, and removing insurance is free or charge, then there’s no downside to it. You’ll simply enjoy fewer costs and lower monthly payments.\nIf you don’t fall into those two categories, though, you’ll need to think carefully about whether refinancing to remove your FHA mortgage insurance is the right move. For one, you’ll need to either meet VA or USDA loan eligibility requirements to qualify or, in the case of conventional loans, have at least a 22% equity stake in your home to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance.\nBeyond this, refinancing also comes with fees. According to Freddie Mac, the typical refinance costs anywhere from 3% to 6% of the total loan amount, so on a $200,000 balance, you’d pay between $6,000 to $12,000 just to refinance. You’ll want to run the numbers and determine if removing MIP would save you this much (and ideally more) in the long run. If it won’t, or if you don’t plan to be in the home very long, then keeping your loan as-is might be the better move.\nIf you’re unsure, talk to a loan officer about your options. They can walk you through the math and ensure you’re making the right move for your goals and budget.\nFHA mortgage insurance removal FAQs\nWhat is the difference between MIP and PMI?\nMortgage insurance premium (MIP) and private mortgage insurance (PMI) are both insurance policies that protect lenders in case you default on your mortgage. The main difference between the two is that PMI applies to conventional loans with less than 20% down payments, while MIP is administered by the Federal Housing Administration and applies specifically to FHA loans.\nIs it necessary to have mortgage insurance?\nIt may be. If you take out a conventional loan but put down less than 20%, lenders will typically require you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) to mitigate their risk in case you default on the loan. However, once you’ve built up enough equity in your home — usually when the loan-to-value ratio reaches 80% — you can request that the PMI be canceled. For FHA loans, mortgage insurance is mandatory regardless of your down payment amount. You’ll pay it both upfront and as part of your monthly mortgage payment.\nCan I reduce my mortgage insurance premium?\nIf you don’t qualify to remove FHA MIP and can’t refinance into a conventional loan, you could possibly reduce your MIP with an FHA Streamline Refinance. This program allows you to refinance your FHA loan into a new FHA loan so you can save money. You’ll probably still have to pay MIP, but it could be more affordable than with your original mortgage.\nWhen can you get rid of mortgage insurance on FHA loans?\nIf you made at least a 10% down payment upon buying the house, you can cancel MIP after 11 years have passed on your loan. Your MIP might also be cancellable if it was originated prior to June 3, 2013, and meets other conditions. Otherwise, you will need to refinance into a non-FHA loan in order to remove MIP from your monthly payments.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley.",

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIf you’re on the hunt for a new home, you’re probably planning to take out a mortgage to finance the purchase. You’ll have to decide which kind of home loan makes the most financial sense for your situation.\nTwo popular options for homeowners are FHA and conventional loans. Here’s everything you need to know about these two types of mortgage loans to help you make an informed decision.\nLearn more: Pros and cons of FHA loans\nIn this article:\nFHA vs. conventional loans: An overview\nAn FHA loan is a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration — which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) — and issued by banks, credit unions, and other approved FHA lenders.\nBecause an FHA loan is government-backed, it typically requires a lower credit score and minimum down payment than conventional loans and some other mortgage programs. These factors make FHA loans especially popular with first-time home buyers with little savings or less-than-ideal FICO scores.\nUnlike an FHA loan, a conventional loan isn’t insured by any government agency, which can make it riskier for the mortgage lender. As a result, conventional mortgages typically have stricter eligibility requirements, which means you may need a higher credit score and a larger down payment to qualify.\nConventional loans can be conforming or non-conforming loans. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards and can’t exceed borrowing limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Non-conforming mortgages (like jumbo loans) exceed those conforming loan limits.\nYou can apply for conventional loans at most banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders.\nRead more: The best mortgage lenders right now\nConventional loan vs. FHA loan: Key differences\nIn a nutshell, FHA loans have more lenient down payment and credit score requirements than conventional loans, but they come with mortgage insurance and require an FHA-approved appraisal. Though conventional loans have higher loan limits and don’t require mortgage insurance when you put 20% down, they’re a bit harder to qualify for than FHA loans.\nHere’s a more detailed view of the differences between FHA and conventional loans to help you make the right decision.\nCredit score minimum\nLenders will always look at your credit score, whether you’re applying for an FHA or a conventional loan. Most lenders use the FICO scoring model, which ranges from 300 to 850 points. The higher your score, the more trustworthy you are as a borrower from a lender’s point of view.\nYou generally need a minimum credit score of 620 to be eligible for a conventional mortgage. You can qualify for an FHA home loan with a credit score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment or 580 with a 3.5% down payment.\nAppraisal process\nIf you’re buying a home with a conventional loan, your lender will schedule a home appraisal to ensure the property has sufficient value. This way, both you and the lender know the amount you are paying is comparable to the actual home value.\nThe FHA appraisal process is more demanding than one for a conventional loan. Your property must meet the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s minimum property requirements, so the appraiser will look for specific safety and construction issues.\nSo, the main difference between the two in this aspect is that conventional loan appraisers do not hold your property to HUD's exact standards, whereas FHA appraisers do.\nDown payment requirements\nYou only need to put 3.5% down for FHA loans if your credit score is 580 or higher. If your credit score falls between 500 and 579, you’ll need to come up with a higher down payment of 10%.\nDown payment requirements for conventional loans vary from lender to lender. Some may only require a minimum 3% down payment, while other lenders may ask you to put at least 5% down.\nLearn more: How to get a mortgage with a 1% down payment\nMortgage insurance\nMortgage insurance protects your lender if you default on your loan.\nFor conventional loans, you’ll need to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you put less than 20% down. According to the government-sponsored entity Freddie Mac, you can expect to pay between $30 and $70 monthly per $100,000 financed.\nFor FHA loans, you must pay a mortgage insurance premium (MIP) for the life of the loan, regardless of how much you put down. The only exceptions are if your loan origination date was June 3, 2013, or later, and you made a down payment of at least 10%. In this case, your FHA mortgage insurance is removed after 11 years. You can also remove FHA MIP if your loan origination date was between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 2, 2013, and you’ve reached 22% equity in your home.\nMIP consists of two parts: the up-front mortgage premium, which is 1.75% of your base loan amount, and the annual MIP, which depends on various factors.\nLearn more: How to get rid of PMI\nLoan limits\nLoan limits cap the amount you can borrow for a house, so you’ll want to pay attention to the loan limit for the area where you’re shopping for homes.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) publishes annual conforming loan limits that apply to all conventional loans. For 2025, the conforming loan limit for one-unit single-family homes is $806,500, with higher-cost areas at $1,209,750. If you need to borrow more, you must take out a jumbo loan.\nThe 2025 FHA loan limit for a one-unit property in a lower-cost area is $524,225, but in high-cost areas such as Los Angeles, the ceiling is also $1,209,750. Visit the HUD website for more information on FHA mortgage limits.\nRead more: Requirements to get an FHA loan\nCan you refinance from an FHA loan to a conventional loan?\nYes, you can refinance out of an FHA loan if you meet the eligibility for a conventional loan, such as having a credit score of at least 620 and a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) below 50%. Though refinancing from an FHA loan to a conventional loan may not be for everyone, it’s worth considering if you want to remove FHA mortgage insurance and potentially access larger loan amounts.\nLearn more: How to refinance from an FHA to conventional loan\nCan you refinance from a conventional loan to a FHA loan?\nYou can refinance from a conventional loan into an FHA loan with two specific types of refinancing: an FHA cash-out refinance or FHA 203(k) refinance, two options available to homeowners with any type of loan. But you typically won’t want to do so unless it’s a last resort.\nBy converting into an FHA loan, you’ll eat away at your equity with the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance charges, regardless of how much equity you’ve built up. So, though the rates may be lower on FHA loans, it may not make financial sense to refinance into one when you factor in MIP, closing costs, and other expenses associated with it.\nLearn more: How much are FHA loan closing costs?\nFHA loan vs. conventional loan: Which is better?\nIt depends. A conventional loan might be better if you have good or excellent credit and can manage a 20% down payment since you’ll most likely qualify for an affordable mortgage rate and avoid PMI. However, a loan backed by the FHA might be your only option if you have a less-than-ideal credit score that falls anywhere between the 500s or low 600s.\nEven if you have a small down payment, it might be worth choosing a conventional loan so you don’t have to pay for FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. Talk with mortgage lenders to compare overall costs and determine which mortgage makes the most sense mathematically.\nLearn more:\nFHA vs. conventional loans FAQs\nWhat is the downside to an FHA loan?\nOne of the biggest downsides of an FHA loan is the up-front and annual mortgage insurance, which can be tricky to get rid of. The up-front mortgage insurance premium costs 1.75% of the original mortgage principal at closing, and the annual MIP varies depending on your mortgage size, term length, and loan-to-value. Another downside to FHA loans is the loan limit. In most parts of the U.S., FHA loans only allow you to borrow up to $524,225 for a one-unit property, whereas conventional loans may allow you to borrow up to $806,500.\nWhat is the downside of a conventional loan?\nOne disadvantage of a conventional loan is that the rates may be higher for people with less-than-great credit scores than with other types of mortgages. Conventional loans typically have stricter eligibility requirements than government-backed loans like FHA loans.\nWhy do sellers want conventional over FHA loans?\nTo some sellers, a homebuyer who qualifies for conventional financing is less risky and more trustworthy than borrowers who qualify for an FHA loan. This is because conventional loans typically require a higher credit score and more money down, which means those who qualify for these loans might be considered more financially responsible and creditworthy.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley"

            "Cuomo's lead shrinks with under one week until New York City mayoral primary: poll. The 2025 race for New York City mayor is tightening, with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's lead shrinking with less than a week to go until the crucial June 24 Democratic Party mayoral primary, a new poll indicates.\nA Marist Institute for Public Opinion poll released Wednesday shows that Cuomo – the former three-term governor – is the top choice for 38% of likely Democratic primary voters in New York City.\nCuomo, who resigned in 2021 during his third term as New York State governor amid multiple scandals, is now aiming for a political comeback and working to redeem his damaged image.\nZorhan Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist state assemblyman from Queens, stands in second place in the poll, with 27% support in the primary, which is conducted using a ranked-choice voting system in which voters rank candidates by preference on their ballots.\nCUOMO TARGETS TRUMP AS HE QUESTIONS MAMDANI'S EXPERIENCE IN NYC PRIMARY BATTLE\nMamdani, who is originally from Uganda, cut Cuomo's lead by nearly half from a Marist poll conducted a month ago, thanks in part to consolidating progressive support in the 11-candidate mayoral primary field.\nProgressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City's most prominent leader on the left, endorsed Mamdani earlier this month. Earlier this week, longtime progressive champion and two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders backed Mamdani.\nWith multiple candidates on the left running in the primary, the endorsements by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders aimed to consolidate the support of progressive voters behind Mamdani.\nAOC BACKS RISING PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE IN NYC DEM PRIMARY IN PUSH TO DEFEAT FRONTRUNNER CUOMO\n\"Mamdani is clearly in Cuomo’s rearview mirror,\" Marist polling director Lee M. Miringoff told Fox News.\nThe poll indicates that New York City Comptroller Brad Lander is a distant third in the primary battle.\nThe survey was conducted June 9-12, before the final debate between the candidates and ahead of Lander's arrest on Tuesday by Department of Homeland Security agents in Manhattan, after allegedly assaulting a federal officer as Lander tried to escort a defendant out of an immigration court.\nThe poll was also conducted before the launch of an ad blitz questioning Mamdani's experience leading a city of more than 8 million people.\n\"Zohran Mamdani’s a 33-year-old dangerously inexperienced legislator who’s passed just three bills with a staff you can fit inside a New York elevator,\" the narrator in a Cuomo campaign ad said. \"We need someone ready to roll. Andrew Cuomo managed a state and managed crises, from COVID to Trump.\"\nTHIS BILLIONAIRE FORMER NYC MAYOR ENDORSES CUOMO AHEAD OF PRIMARY\nCuomo adviser and spokesperson Rich Azzopardi, when asked by Fox News about the new Marist survey, said, \"This is the second poll in two days that showed Andrew Cuomo beginning and ending rank choice voting with a double-digit lead in a crowded multi-candidate race. These are serious times and New Yorkers know that Andrew Cuomo is the only candidate with the experience and the real record of results to fix what’s broken and put the city back on the right track.\"\nThe 67-year-old Cuomo has spent the past four years fighting to clear his name after 11 sexual harassment accusations, which he has repeatedly denied, forced his resignation. He was also under investigation at the time for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic amid allegations his administration vastly understated COVID-related deaths at state nursing homes.\nLast month, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Cuomo after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about the decisions he made as governor during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMore than 130,000 Democrats have already cast ballots in early voting in the Democratic primary, ahead of next Tuesday's election.\nANDREW CUOMO THE BIGGEST TARGET AS NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL PRIMARY HEATS UP\nThe winner of the Democratic Party primary is traditionally seen as the overwhelming frontrunner in the November general election in the heavily blue city.\nHowever, this year, the general election campaign may be a bit more unpredictable.\nIncumbent Mayor Eric Adams, a moderate Democrat elected in 2021, is running for re-election as an independent. Adams earlier this year dropped his Democratic primary bid as his approval ratings sank to historic lows.\nWhile he is not on the ballot, President Donald Trump has taken center stage on the campaign trail in the closing weeks of the New York City primary battle.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCuomo and many of the other candidates in the race have heavily criticized Trump's recent move to place National Guard troops and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles in an effort to quell unrest sparked by an increase in ICE arrests of illegal immigrants orchestrated by the administration.\nThe candidates are vowing to protect the city from what they suggest is a possible future federal crackdown against immigration protests in New York City.",
            "Why establishment Democrats still can’t stomach progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani | Arwa Mahdawi. Who’s afraid of Zohran Mamdani? The answer, it would seem, is the entire establishment. The 33-year-old democratic socialist and New York City mayoral candidate has surged in the polls in recent weeks, netting endorsements not just from progressive voices like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders but also his fellow candidates for the mayoralty, with Brad Lander and Michael Blake taking advantage of the ranked-choice voting system in the primary and cross-endorsing Mamdani’s campaign.\nWith the primary just around the corner, polls have Mamdani closing the gap on Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor of New York. This has spooked the establishment, which is now doing everything it can to stop Mamdani’s rise.\nTake Michael Bloomberg, who endorsed Cuomo earlier this month and followed this up with a $5m donation to a pro-Cuomo Pac. The largesse appears motivated not by admiration for Cuomo – during his mayoralty, sources told the New York Times that Bloomberg saw Cuomo as “the epitome of the self-interested, horse-trading political culture he has long stood against” – but animosity towards Mamdani and his policies.\nMamdani wants to increase taxes on residents earning more than $1m a year, increase corporate taxes and freeze rents: policies that aren’t exactly popular with the billionaire set.\nBronx congressman Ritchie Torres (who was once progressive but moved steadily away from that and now receives fundraising assistance from far-right donors) is another establishment Democrat trying to prevent a Mamdani win at all costs. Torres, who makes his pro-Israel positions explicit, has criticized Mamdani for pro-Palestine comments. Torres has even said he won’t run for governor in 2026 if a socialist like Mamdani becomes the mayor because it will “revolutionize the political landscape”.\nThe New York Times’ editorial board is also aghast at Mamdani’s sudden popularity. On Monday, it published a piece urging New Yorkers to completely leave the candidate off their ranked-choice ballot, arguing that the assemblyman is woefully underqualified for office and has a bunch of wacky progressive ideas that will never work including free buses and frozen rent. The Times, which announced almost a year ago that it will not make endorsements in local elections, did not officially endorse a candidate but it certainly didn’t tell people not to put Cuomo on the ballot. It seems being accused of sexually harassing multiple women and then going after those women in an aggressive and intrusive way (including demanding gynecological records) isn’t as disqualifying as progressive policies. And, of course, the sexual harassment is just one of many scandals that Cuomo has weathered, including allegations he covered up nursing home deaths during the pandemic.\nThe Atlantic also came out with an anti-Mamdani piece, albeit one that was more subtle and which focused on the process rather than the personality. Staff writer Annie Lowrey argued that ranked-choice voting in a mayor primary, used by New York City since 2021, is not truly democratic: “Without ranked-choice voting, Cuomo would probably steamroll his competition. With ranked-choice voting, Mamdani could defeat him.” While there are problems with ranked choice (as there are with first-past-the-post systems), I think the bigger democratic threat might be a system in which a billionaire can swoop in with millions to prop up their preferred candidate at the last minute.\nAll of this is anti-Mamdani mobilization is depressingly predictable: the Democratic establishment is allergic to fresh blood and new thinking. Shortly after Trump won the election last year, and the Democrats also lost the House and the Senate, Ocasio-Cortez launched a bid to become the lead Democrat on the House oversight committee, which is an important minority leadership position. Ocasio-Cortez has become a lot more establishment-friendly since getting into power in 2018 (New York Magazine even decreed in 2023 that she is just a “Regular Old Democrat Now”), but she’s still not centrist enough for the Democrats, it seems. Nancy Pelosi reportedly sabotaged the 35-year-old congresswoman’s ambitions and ensured that 74-year-old Gerry Connolly, who had esophagus cancer at the time, got the job instead. Connolly died age 75 earlier this year, becoming the sixth House Democrat to have died in office in 12 months.\nThen there’s the Democratic backlash to David Hogg, the young Parkland shooting survivor turned politico. The 25-year-old was briefly vice-chair of the Democratic national committee but stepped on powerful toes by criticizing the party for its “seniority politics”. Hogg, who has said that he’s worried about his generation losing faith in democracy, pitched competitive primaries which challenged Democratic incumbents who had become too complacent, injecting new blood into the party. This did not go down well and various members of the DNC had voted to hold new vice-chair elections that could have led to his ouster. Instead of waiting to be kicked out, Hogg recently said he would step away from the role.\nI am not a Mamdani evangelist, but while some of his ideas are a little pie in the sky, he’s authentic and ready to fight for normal people rather than corporate interests. Sure, he doesn’t have a lot of experience. But he has a huge amount of potential. He’s managed to get at least 26,000 New Yorkers to volunteer for him. And I don’t mean they’ve sent a couple of text messages: one week they knocked on almost 100,000 doors. Michael Spear, a professor of history and political science at a Brooklyn college, told Jacobin the degree to which Mamdani’s campaign has galvanized New York City voters is unprecedented: “I don’t think there is anything like it” in New York history.\nNobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great. Everyone knows there is a need for change and yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring that change. Instead of rallying around fresh talent like Mamdani that can clearly mobilize young voters, the Democrats are mulling a $20m plan to try to manufacture a “Joe Rogan of the left” who can connect with young men, rather than support an authentic grassroots candidate who is already connecting with them.\nWill centrist interests prevail in New York? We won’t know until, at the very earliest, late on primary night, 24 June. Whatever happens, though, you can bet that Democrats will continue to do their very best to kneecap anyone who wants to drag them way from their obsession with doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.",
            "NYC Mayoral Race Poll Shows Progressive Zohran Mamdani Closing In on Cuomo. Democratic socialist assemblymember Zohran Mamdani has come within striking distance of Andrew Cuomo in newly released polling for the upcoming New York City mayoral election, with the breakout candidate being within a margin of error of triumphing over the disgraced governor in a head-to-head primary race.\nA Data for Progress survey of likely Democratic primary voters found that Mamdani is just seven points behind Cuomo in the first round of New York City’s ranked choice voting system, with other left-leaning candidates like Brad Lander garnering a proportion of higher rankings. Every candidate but Mamdani and Cuomo is in the single digits.\nAs other candidates are eliminated in subsequent rounds, Cuomo’s lead grows smaller. In the final round, in a head-to-head race between the two, Cuomo leads by just two points, garnering 51 percent of the vote, with Mamdani at 49 percent. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus three points.\nCrucially, the poll was conducted between May 30 and June 4 — ending just a day before Mamdani secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), who endorsed the left-wing candidate following his skillful performance at the first mayoral debate and said she would rank him first on her primary ballot.\nThe endorsement from such a high profile politician may have been particularly important, as polls have suggested that one of Mamdani’s largest roadblocks is name recognition over the former governor. A Data for Progress poll conducted in March, for instance, found that Cuomo led Mamdani by 24 points in the first round of voting, while a faceoff between the two would have Cuomo winning by 70 percent to Mamdani’s 30 percent.\nBut, due in part to a massive canvassing campaign for Mamdani and his often-viral social media videos, Mamdani has been surging in recognition and popularity. His policy platform of making New York City more affordable with proposals like a citywide rent freeze for rent stabilized apartments stands, for young voters especially, in sharp contrast to Cuomo — a Democratic establishment candidate who is well-known, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.\nMeanwhile, Data for Progress’s latest polling suggests that Mamdani has even more room to grow in terms of name recognition and popularity.\nAccording to the survey, 28 percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about Mamdani to form an opinion. Well over half, or 58 percent, said they had a favorable opinion of him, versus only 15 percent who said they had an unfavorable view — a 43-point gap.\nOn the other hand, the polling found that voters have a net unfavorable opinion of Cuomo, with 48 percent saying they favor him while 4 percent said they view him unfavorably.\nKeep the press free.

(AP) — The NAACP filed an intent to sue Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI on Tuesday over concerns about air pollution generated by a supercomputer located near predominantly Black communities. READ MORE: Elon Musk backs off from feud with Trump, saying he regrets social media posts that ‘went too far’ The xAI data center began operating gas turbines last year, emitting air pollution, without first applying for a permit under an exemption that allowed them to do so for 364 days. The permit application now being considered by the Shelby County Health Department calls for the use of 15 turbines, though the Southern Environmental Law Center says there are as many as 35 turbines located at the sprawling facility. Musk’s xAI said the turbines will be equipped with technology to reduce emissions — and that it’s already boosting the city’s economy by investing billions of dollars in the supercomputer facility, paying millions in local taxes and creating hundreds of jobs. The company also is spending $35 million to build a power substation and $80 million to build a water recycling plant to the support Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, the local utility.

            "NAACP Files Intent To Sue Elon Musk's AI Company Over Supercomputer Air Pollution. MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The NAACP and an environmental group said Tuesday that they intend to sue Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI over concerns about air pollution generated by a supercomputer facility located near predominantly Black communities in Memphis.\nThe xAI data center began operating last year, powered in part by pollution-emitting gas turbines, without first applying for a permit. Officials have said an exemption allowed them to operate for up to 364 days without a permit, but Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Patrick Anderson said at a news conference that there is no such exemption for turbines — and that regardless, it has now been more than 364 days.\nA 60-day notice of an intent to sue, a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit under the Clean Air Act, was sent to xAI in a letter. The SELC is representing the NAACP in its possible legal challenge against xAI and its permit application, now being considered by the Shelby County Health Department.\nThe xAI company responds\nThe company said Tuesday that it takes its commitment to the community and environment seriously.\n“The temporary power generation units are operating in compliance with all applicable laws,” an xAI statement said.\nMusk’s xAI has said the turbines will be equipped with technology to reduce emissions — and that it’s already boosting the city’s economy by investing billions of dollars in the supercomputer facility, paying millions in local taxes and creating hundreds of jobs. The company also is spending $35 million to build a power substation and $80 million to build a water recycling plant to the support Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, the local utility.\nThe chamber of commerce in Memphis made a surprise announcement in June 2024 that xAI planned to build a supercomputer in the city. The data center quickly set up shop in an industrial park south Memphis, near factories and a gas-powered plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\nWhat opponents are saying\nOpponents say the supercomputing center is stressing the power grid. They contend that the turbines emit smog and carbon dioxide, pollutants that cause lung irritation such as nitrogen oxides and the carcinogen formaldehyde.\nThe SELC said the use of the turbines violates the Clean Air Act, and that residents who live near the xAI facility already face cancer risks at four times the national average. The group also has sent a petition to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nCritics say xAI installed the turbines without any oversight or notice to the community. The company requests to operate 15 turbines at the site, but the SELC said it hired a firm to fly over the facility and found up to 35 turbines operating there at times.\nThe permit itself says emissions from the site “will be an area source for hazardous air pollutants.” A permit would allow the health department, which has received 1,700 public comments about the permit, to monitor air quality near the facility.\nA contentious public meeting\nOpponents of the facility say city leaders have not been transparent with the community about their dealings with xAI, and they are sacrificing the health of residents in return for financial benefit.\nAt a community meeting hosted by the county health department in April, many of the people speaking in opposition cited the additional pollution burden in a city that already received an “F” grade for ozone pollution from the American Lung Association.\nA statement read by xAI’s Brent Mayo at the meeting said the company wants to “strengthen the fabric of the community,” and estimated that tax revenues from the data center are likely to exceed $100 million by next year.\n“This tax revenue will support vital programs like public safety, health and human services, education, firefighters, police, parks and so much more,” said the statement.\nThe company also apparently wants to expand: The chamber of commerce said in March that xAI had purchased a 1 million square-foot property at a second location, not far from the current facility.\nThe mayor of Memphis weighs in\nMayor Paul Young said In his weekly newsletter Friday that an ordinance now requires that 25% of xAI’s city property tax revenue be reinvested directly into neighborhoods within 5 miles of the facility.\nYoung also said that no tax incentives or public dollars are tied to the project.\n“Let’s be clear, this isn’t a debate between the environment and economics,” Young said. “It’s about putting people before politics. It’s about building something better for communities that have waited far too long for real investment.”\nBoxtown punches back\nOne nearby neighborhood dealing with decades of industrial pollution is Boxtown, a tight-knit community founded by freed slaves in the 1860s. It was named Boxtown after residents used material dumped from railroad boxcars to fortify their homes. The area features houses, wooded areas and wetlands, and its inhabitants are mostly working class residents.\nBoxtown won a victory in 2021 against two corporations that sought to build an oil pipeline through the area. Valero and Plains All American Pipeline canceled the project after protests by residents and activists led by State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, who called it a potential danger to the community and an aquifer that provides clean drinking water to Memphis.\nPearson, who represents nearby neighborhoods, said “clean air is a human right” as he called for people in Memphis to unite against xAI.\n“There is not a person, no matter how wealthy or how powerful, that can deny the fact that everybody has a right to breathe clean air,” said Pearson, who compared the fight against xAI to David and Goliath.\n“We’re all right to be David, because we know how the story ends,” he said.\n____\nReporter Travis Loller contributed from Nashville, Tenn.",
            "'How come I can’t breathe?': Musk's data company draws a backlash in Memphis. ‘How come I can’t breathe?': Musk’s data company draws a backlash in Memphis\nThe company’s turbines — enough to power 280,000 homes — run without emission controls in an area that leads Tennessee in asthma hospitalizations.\nMEMPHIS, Tennessee — Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company is belching smog-forming pollution into an area of South Memphis that already leads the state in emergency department visits for asthma.\nNone of the 35 methane gas turbines that help power xAI’s massive supercomputer is equipped with pollution controls typically required by federal rules.\nThe company has no Clean Air Act permits.\nIn just 11 months since the company arrived in Memphis, xAI has become one of Shelby County’s largest emitters of smog-producing nitrogen oxides, according to calculations by environmental groups whose data has been reviewed by POLITICO’s E&E News. The plant is in an area whose air is already considered unhealthy due to smog.\nThe turbines spew nitrogen oxides, also known as NOx, at an estimated rate of 1,200 to 2,000 tons a year — far more than the gas-fired power plant across the street or the oil refinery down the road. That’s according to calculations by the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group that focuses on the South, which used turbine manufacturer spec sheets to estimate xAI’s annual emissions and compare them with pollution that other South Memphis plants have reported to the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory.\nThe turbines were necessary to get the third version of the company’s AI chatbot up and running in time, Musk said at the product’s launch in February, adding: “We have generators on one side of the building, just trailer after trailer of generators until we can get the utility power to come in.” He has not publicly addressed the pollution concerns and did not respond to requests for comment about the turbines powering the plant and their lack of pollution controls.\nJust three miles away is Boxtown, a secluded neighborhood that officially became part of the city of Memphis in 1968, the year that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel downtown. While the annexation had come with the promise of connecting Boxtown to municipal utilities, many homes still had no running water or sewage service as late as the 1970s.\nToday, more than 90 percent of residents living in Boxtown’s ZIP code are Black, with a median household income of $36,000, according to the Census Bureau. It’s also home to more than 17 industrial facilities — some of which share an industrial park with xAI — that release enough toxic pollution to require registration with EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory.\n“I can’t breathe at home, it smells like gas outside,” Boxtown resident Alexis Humphreys said through tears, holding up her asthma inhaler during a public hearing about the turbines on April 25. “How come I can’t breathe at home and y’all get to breathe at home?”\nTogether the turbines produce enough energy to power 280,000 homes. XAI has been relying on them because the data processing center’s voracious appetite for energy has outpaced electric utilities’ ability to serve it.\nThe turbines are only temporary and don’t require federal permits for their emissions of NOx and other hazardous air pollutants like formaldehyde, xAI’s environmental consultant, Shannon Lynn, said during a webinar hosted by the Memphis Chamber of Commerce. The argument appears to rely on a loophole in federal regulations that environmental groups and former EPA officials say shouldn’t apply to the situation.\nIn January, facing pressure from neighbors and environmental groups, xAI applied for permits for 15 of its turbines, which it says will be permanent.\nBut Lynn said the company will wait until its application is approved before it installs pollution controls on the turbines it keeps onsite. That installation “will make xAI the lowest-emitting facility in the country,” the company’s local representative, Brent Mayo, said at a permit hearing about the turbines.\nMayo and Lynn didn’t respond to calls and texts from POLITICO’s E&E News requesting comment and have not said publicly how much longer the “temporary” turbines will remain onsite. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe strategy violates the Clean Air Act, argued Bruce Buckheit, who formerly directed EPA’s air enforcement division. At a minimum, he said, the turbines that will remain onsite should have had pollution controls from the start.\n“There needs to be a permit beforehand,” he said. “You don’t just get that first year for free.”\nThe Memphis xAI showdown could become a national test case for artificial intelligence, which demands more electricity than regular internet searches to complete even simple tasks. Utilities across the country have struggled to keep up with the electricity demands of “hyper users” like data centers, which are often left to find their own power sources behind the meter.\nThe Trump administration, while allowing Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate programs dedicated to reducing the disproportionate amount of pollution in communities of color, has also vowed to support artificial intelligence. Before EPA said it would fire or reassign some 450 employees working on environmental justice initiatives late last month, the agency listed making “the United States the artificial intelligence capital of the world” among five agency priorities “that will guide EPA’s work.” EPA has also issued new guidance easing pollution rules for some internal combustion engines commonly used by data centers.\n“Data centers are a highly competitive space, and other companies are watching what xAI does,” said Amanda Garcia, senior attorney for the SELC, which has advocated for data centers to use more renewable energy to reduce their pollution and draw from the grid. ”Right now, what xAI is doing is essentially running a power plant without a permit, and it has a real risk of harming people’s health.”\nXAI’s main product is Musk’s chatbot, Grok, which also generates images. It has become known for having fewer user guardrails than other artificial intelligence programs, like ChatGPT, which often prevent users from requesting images that violate copyright standards or are deemed insensitive. Grok allows users to make deepfakes depicting things like Mickey Mouse wearing a Nazi uniform. Musk has called it “the most fun AI in the world.”\nBoxtown residents say they have been paying for the images with their health.\nAt a public hearing on the xAI permits at Fairley High School on April 25, multiple residents described cases of asthma and cancer in their families they attribute to air pollution, asking for the Shelby County Department of Health to deny xAI’s permit and shut down all the turbines. Many have health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that predate xAI’s arrival in South Memphis. But NOx emissions are known to worsen lung conditions, and residents fear that the sheer volume released by xAI will further harm their health. Some, like Humphreys, showed their inhalers and portable oxygen tanks as proof of the damage.\nMany see xAI as just the latest example of Memphis designating their community as a “sacrifice zone,” said KeShaun Pearson, who leads the nonprofit Memphis Community Against Pollution. Both his grandmothers died of cancer in their 60s, and Pearson blames pollution for their deaths.\n“It’s amazing when you grow up and realize how redlining has allowed these industries to kill your family,” he said in an interview. “Elon Musk is a representation of the oligarchy we already knew was operating under Jim Crow. It’s a familiar evil.”\n‘Elvis is in the building’\nThe Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce heralds xAI’s arrival as a success.\nAn organization dedicated to economic development, the chamber actively courted xAI last spring, its President Ted Townsend said in an interview. But the decision about where to host the supercomputer powering Musk’s company came down to electricity. Colossus, as Musk calls it, contained some 100,000 computer chips at the time and demanded 150 megawatts of power.\nTownsend and the head of Memphis Light, Gas and Water signed nondisclosure agreements with xAI and in private meetings helped the company craft a plan, Townsend told POLITICO’s E&E News in an interview. They directed xAI to a former oven factory vacated just a couple of years prior that was already equipped with a gas hookup and a substation that could immediately supply 8 MW of power. During the meetings, the utility agreed to support xAI’s request for 150 MW, which would need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority’s board of directors.\n“The AI race is just that, it’s a race,” Townsend said. “So expediting and building out infrastructure as quickly as possible in the most appropriate ways, within the lines of regulations and laws, that is how we have been instructed and guided.”\nThe Memphis utility declined to make its president, Doug McGowen, available for an interview or answer written questions about xAI’s power supply, referring all comment requests to the Chamber of Commerce.\nLeft out of those negotiations were the Memphis City Council; the county Board of Commissioners; and TVA, whose board ultimately had to approve any requests for more than 100 MW of power.\nThey only learned about the deal in early June, after the deal was done, when Musk announced it with a post on X referencing Memphis’ illustrious music history: “Elvis is in the building.”\nAlmost immediately after becoming public, the deal sparked concerns about how xAI’s power use would affect Memphis residents. As recently as 2022, high demand during winter storms has forced TVA to undergo rolling blackouts on some of the coldest days.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water officials told the public not to worry, saying xAI had brought its own gas generators to power the data center before the TVA board voted on the power request. The company could also rely on the turbines when the authority called on industrial users to reduce their draw during times of high demand.\nTypically, stationary gas turbines need permits before they can be turned on due to the levels of NOx and other pollutants they generate. The permitting process helps ensure that emitters use technology to limit air pollution. There are more stringent guidelines for NOx emissions in an already smoggy area like Shelby County. Smog, a mixture of gases and chemicals, can exacerbate lung diseases like asthma and increase hospital visits.\nOther data centers have sought permits for the same make and model of gas turbines used by xAI before beginning construction.\nBut in August, the Shelby County Health Department said it had not issued any permits for the turbines, writing in a letter that EPA had agreed the department “does not currently have authority regarding those mobile gas burning turbines” because they were only temporary.\nThe letter included a copy of the request that department Director Michelle Taylor had made to EPA earlier that month saying that “a statement acknowledging mobile source gas-powered turbines do not require a local Title V permit until they have remained in the same location for more than 364 days would be advantageous to all parties concerned.”\nThat explanation didn’t make sense to the SELC’s Garcia. The Health Department seemed to be referencing an exemption in the law for smaller gas generators, like those used to power asphalt crushers for road projects. But Garcia said the turbines at xAI were big enough and generated enough electricity that they should instead have had to obtain permits as stationary sources, even if they were portable.\nThe SELC told the Health Department as much in multiple letters, but neither Shelby County nor xAI has cited a legal argument for why the turbines should be exempt.\nLocals feared Memphis had become yet another example of Musk’s companies pushing fast-paced development while disregarding environmental regulations. There was Tesla, which in 2021 was cited for 33 air quality violations in California; SpaceX, which has been fined by Texas for allegedly dumping industrial wastewater without a permit; and Musk’s underground tunneling business, The Boring Co., which was also fined by Texas for failing to get a permit to discharge industrial stormwater.\nSince August, the number of gas turbines at the xAI site has only grown, with information only coming to light after community pushback.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water and chamber officials initially suggested last summer there were 18 turbines of varying sizes. But then, when xAI filed a permit application in January, it listed 15 machines, at 16 MW each. Then, at the end of March, environmental groups flew over the facility and came back with aerial photos showing 35 turbines onsite. Memphis Mayor Paul Young defended the company, saying only 15 were actually running and that the rest were for backup.\nBut in late April, environmental groups sent a plane with thermal cameras to fly over the facility and found 33 turbines giving off significant amounts of heat — a sign they were also generating electricity and pollution.\n“The way they have come into the city, it’s like, oh, you think we are unintelligent, you think that the people in these communities aren’t able to comprehend what you are doing and will take this assault on our health lying down,” 15-year-old Boxtown resident Jasmine Bernard said.\nYoung did not respond to an interview request.\nLynn, the environmental consultant listed on xAI’s permit application, also didn’t respond to emails and phone calls for comment. He did speak at a webinar hosted by the Chamber of Commerce in late April to answer community concerns about the turbines. Lynn didn’t disclose his connection to xAI during the webinar and was introduced as only “an expert … who brings decades of experience on environmental compliance issues.”\nIn the webinar, Lynn said xAI did not need air permits for 35 turbines already onsite because “there’s rules that say temporary sources can be in place for up to 364 days a year. They are not subject to permitting requirements.”\nIf a permit is approved, only seven of the current turbines will remain onsite, and they will be “retrofitted” with selective catalytic reduction pollution controls that will limit NOx pollution to 2 parts per million. By contrast, that make and model of turbine emits NOx at a rate of 9 parts per million, while emissions from other models of turbines onsite can be as high as 25 parts per million, according to their manufacturers. Another eight turbines, also with pollution controls, will be brought in.\n“That’s why we’re filing a permit because you have to have a permit for a stationary source,” Lynn said.\nThe other 28 turbines currently onsite are “temporary,” he said, and will be “slowly” moved out as xAI completes work building two substations. But the timeline for that is unclear, because only one of the substations has received the required approval of the TVA board. Townsend, the Chamber of Commerce president, said he doesn’t know what xAI’s timeline is.\n‘How does the county know?’\nThe SELC says xAI’s turbines are too large to take advantage of the temporary permitting loophole and should be regulated as stationary sources of pollution, even if they are technically portable. John Walke, a former attorney in EPA’s Office of General Counsel who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, agrees that all the turbines require stationary source permits.\n“XAI’s position is quite suspect — I mean, they’re huge,” he said. “The temporary or not temporary argument is irrelevant.”\nNeither Walke nor Buckheit, the former EPA enforcement official, is involved in the case. Buckheit says that at a minimum, the seven turbines that will remain onsite should have had a permit before they were running. The Health Department, he said, should have asked for proof upfront that xAI’s turbines would be removed within a year before accepting the company’s position that they were temporary.\n“It’s been many months. Unless they are going to be shutting them down soon, they will have violated the law,” he said. “How does the county know that they are going to be done within a year? Does the county care?”\nIt’s not clear what steps Shelby County took in determining that the turbines didn’t require permits or when that decision was made.\nTownsend maintained the Health Department “was involved from day one.” Taylor, the Health Department director, declined an interview request but has publicly implied she was also left in the dark.\nAt the April permit hearing, Taylor said her office became aware of the turbines when the SELC asked for a copy of the air permit. She said she wanted to “remind everybody in this room” to “engage the Shelby Health Department early regarding new projects so that we can look into what the environmental impacts will be.”\n“If we do not know if something is coming, we cannot do that research,” she said. “Shelby County Health Department cannot assist with projects it is not aware of at the inception.”\n‘All very important to President Trump’\nEPA’s role is also unclear.\nThe Health Department had a brief consultation with EPA in early August on the matter, during which the Health Department says the federal regulator agreed with the decision not to require a permit for the turbines.\nBut last November, EPA Region 4 Air and Radiation Director Denisse Diaz wrote to Taylor saying that although the agency’s understanding was “the turbines are expected to cease operations in the next few months,” it would conduct a more formal review process to confirm. She also suggested the county set up air monitoring to confirm emissions from the turbines. That hasn’t happened.\n“The EPA will need more specific information about the generator units operating at the xAI site,” says the letter obtained by E&E News.\nThe letter was sent just days before the presidential election.\nEPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said the agency is reviewing a “request for assistance” from Shelby County.\nSince taking office in January, the Trump administration has made efforts to boost the nation’s burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. Vaseliou said her agency is “eager to work with AI leaders as it begins work to streamline permitting and regulations that will help accelerate American data center development.”\nShe added that EPA “looks forward to working with AI leaders” as it begins to roll back some 31 pollution-limiting regulations announced in March. EPA has also billed its move to relax pollution rules limiting how long reciprocating internal combustion engines can run without a permit as one to help boost AI. The engines are commonly used to power pumps and compressors in power and manufacturing plants, often during emergency events. New EPA guidance would allow some of those engines to operate for up to 50 hours per year outside of emergencies in a move it is billing as “the first and certainly not the last step” to ensuring data centers and utilities have reliable power.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin himself vowed to support AI while “unleashing American energy dominance” in an appearance on Fox News shortly after the massive rollback was announced.\n“These are all very important to President Trump, so they are important to me,” he said.\nXAI’s Mayo reposted a clip of the interview on X, adding, “Preach.”\nPowering the recent surge of data centers has become a struggle for utilities nationwide due to supercomputers’ massive energy requirements and related strain on the electric grid.\nMost utilities typically offer electricity to commercial users at discount rates in recognition of their high demand and the economic impact industrial users can have on a community. But data centers have a voracious appetite for power and create comparatively few jobs, leading some utilities to consider higher rates for “hyper users.”\nThat includes the TVA board, which was planning to consider new rates for data centers, including xAI, at its May board meeting. But the board can no longer approve resolutions after President Donald Trump fired two of its members. Consideration of the data center measure has been postponed, TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe proliferation of data centers has also contributed to a gas turbine shortage, as utilities look to build up power generation to serve the supercomputers and as other companies, like xAI, turn to producing their own electricity.\nXAI’s demand for power has only grown since it came to Memphis last June. After months of tests, Colossus came fully online in September. That same day, Musk posted on X that it would double the number of computer chips onsite to 200,000 “in a few months.”\nHe has said Colossus will require 2,000 MW to power its expansion. So far, TVA has only approved xAI’s initial request for 150 MW. The 15 turbines it wants permitted produce only 420 more. In October, xAI asked Memphis Light, Gas and Water to study the possibility of supplying an additional 260 MW through a new substation on another swath of land xAI recently leased in South Memphis, but the substation can’t be built until TVA approves sending electricity to it, which could take months.\n“It will be the most powerful training cluster in the world,” Musk said of the expansion in February while announcing the latest iteration of Grok. “We are not stopping here.”\n‘Our lungs … on the auction block’\nFor residents of Boxtown and South Memphis, xAI’s arrival was a setback after a series of recent environmental victories.\nTwo years ago, local opposition stopped a planned 50-mile oil pipeline planned to run from a South Memphis Valero refinery through and around neighborhoods like Boxtown. It was meant as a key final piece of a 1,000-mile plan to bring North Dakota crude to the Gulf Coast for export, but it was stopped after the City Council passed a law to restrict development.\nThen, in April, a medical sterilization plant that had been emitting carcinogenic ethylene oxide closed after decades of residents blaming it for high cancer rates in the area.\nThe Memphis Chamber of Commerce’s support of xAI and the turbines’ lack of permits felt like a betrayal to many in the community.\n“They put our lungs and our air on the auction block and sold us to the richest man in the world,” state Rep. Justin Pearson, a Democrat and KeShaun Pearson’s brother, said at a protest in late April.\nAt the permit hearing, Taylor said city zoning laws and historical racism were really to blame for the sheer number of polluters in South Memphis. She showed a slide with a zoning map next to a redlining map that real estate lenders used in the 1930s to restrict investment in majority-Black neighborhoods.\n“Right now, we are still using a 1953 zoning map to make zoning decisions, and it looks very much like the 1930s redlining map,” she said. “There are several levels of government responsible for what those maps look like.”\nMore industry could be coming soon.\nSince landing xAI, the Memphis chamber has rebranded the city as a “Digital Delta,” and chip manufacturer Nvidia, as well as Dell and Super Micro, has expressed interest in coming to Bluff City, according to the chamber and xAI.\n“We have established the efficiency, the partnership, really the culture of ‘yes’ that we are able to get to what you need and really provide for our community,” Townsend said.\nCompanies don’t need residents’ permission to locate industry in South Memphis, he said, “as long as they are going through the correct process of permitting.”\n“It doesn’t always require a community to say, ‘Well, we are OK with that or we are not,’” he said. “It’s a capitalistic thing. Companies come in and they operate.”\nDriving past xAI in April, a loud, high-pitched buzzing filled the air, coming from the dozens of turbines that line the side of the building, which is as large as 13 football fields. The air above the semitrailer-sized turbines seemed to shimmer as heat escaped, along with the products of burning methane gas.\nJust a few minutes away, the sidewalk-free streets of Boxtown had an almost-rural feel. Peppered with modest homes and surrounded by leafy trees, Boxtown is a sleepy neighborhood — until chemical and sewage smells waft over from the industrial park.\nSitting in a neighbor’s garden, a few residents debated what to make of the world’s richest man, his turbines and their community.\nThat the latest pollution in this neighborhood was coming from a company owned by Musk added insult to injury for Sarah Gadney.\n“If he’s the richest man in the world, buy this whole community up, make us millionaires, pave those streets with gold,” she joked.\nBut Easter May Knox shook her head. The 74-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lowered the KN95 mask she wore to protect herself from the pollution.\n“He may be a millionaire, a billionaire — whatever kind of ‘aire he is,” she said. “But what we need here is clean air.”"

            "House passes Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill.' See how Louisiana's delegation voted.. WASHINGTON – The U.S. House gave final approval Thursday to President Donald Trump’s tax relief and spending cuts package that Republicans call the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, worked all day and all night to win over Republicans who began Wednesday saying they would not vote for the legislation. Enough Republicans agreed to go along with the necessary but stalled procedural votes to set up a full vote by the House.\nDebate began at 3:28 a.m. on whether to agree with the measure, which had been substantially rewritten in the Senate.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies, D-Brooklyn gave the longest speech in House history against the measure, complaining the Republicans refused amendments that would have allowed Democrats to support the bill.\nAfter Jefferies spoke for 8 hours 44 minutes, Johnson took the floor.\n“My friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we've waited long enough. Some of us have literally been up for days now,” Johnson said. “However you vote today, my friends, the President of the United States, is waiting with his pen, the American people are waiting for this relief.”\nAt 2:28 p.m. Eastern, the House voted 218-to-214 to get the bill to Trump for his signature at a Friday ceremony on Independence Day, which is what the president wanted.\nIn addition to Johnson and Scalise, the other two Republicans in Louisiana’s delegation — Rep. Clay Higgins, of Lafayette; and Rep. Julia Letlow, of Start – voted in favor of the bill. Two GOP representatives joined all Democratic House members voting against the bill, including Rep. Troy Carter, of New Orleans; and Rep. Cleo Fields, of Baton Rouge.\nWhat the bill does\nEven though Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House and 53 of the 100 seats in the Senate, GOP leadership has grappled with finding enough votes at every legislative step.\nThe bill funds Trump’s domestic agenda.\nRepublicans focus mostly on the tax benefits. They argue that, when coupled with regulatory rollbacks, lesser taxes will instigate an investment surge that will energize the U.S. economy and lead to growth enough to lower the deficit.\n“The pro-growth policies within this historic legislation are going to fuel an economic boom like we’ve never seen before,” said Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary.\nDemocratic members counter that the rich will benefit, by far, from the tax cuts and that lower income Americans will partially pay for the bill’s costs through reduced access to Medicaid and food stamps.\nFrom the House floor, in the dark hours Thursday morning, Scalise boiled down the disagreement as a philosophical fight between Democrats and Republicans.\n“They don’t want to give people back their money. They want to keep the power in Washington. That’s really what’s at stake here. That’s the big fight here,” Scalise said. “President Trump is at the helm now. It's a new day. World leaders know it. The bad guys know it around the world. But you know what those hardworking families who have been waiting for this relief for a long, long time, are finally going to realize help is on the way.”\nThe bill makes permanent roughly $3.8 trillion dollars of temporary individual and business tax breaks enacted when Republicans held the majority during Trump’s first term. That 2017 tax break was set to expire in December.\nIf the bill had not been approved, Louisiana taxpayers would have seen a $2,135 increase, on average, in federal taxes next year.\nLower income filers taxes would save about $150 from what they would have paid had the bill not passed, according to The Tax Policy Center, a Washington-based nonpartisan analysis group. Middle income filers, making $66,801-$119,200 annually, would see about a $1,750 tax reduction and those earning over $217,100 annually would save about $12,540 in taxes.\nAbout 85% of the nation’s households would receive a tax cut in 2026.\nThe bill also temporarily allows workers to deduct tips and overtime pay, and provide a new $6,000 deduction for most older adults.\nAll told, the bill's tax provisions reduce federal revenues by about $4.5 trillion over 10 years.\nPlus, the bill increases spending about $350 billion on border security, including building a wall along the Mexican border, and military armaments.\n“We’re cutting $1.7 trillion in this bill, and you’re not going to feel any of it,” Trump said last week.\nMedicaid, other cuts\nTo pay for those expenses, the legislation cuts about $1.1 trillion from Medicaid and other health programs. The bill reduces federal spending on Medicaid by 18% and requires most beneficiaries to work or volunteer 80 hours a month, along with restrictions on how states can tax hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare providers to raise money for a state's portion of Medicaid expenses.\nAbout 17 million Americans – 267,550 in Louisiana – could lose their coverage over a decade when changes to subsidies for the Affordable Care Act are added into the Medicaid revamp.\nRepublicans say their goal is to address “waste, fraud and abuse” and protect the safety net programs for the deserving population, such as low income pregnant women, the disabled and children.\nThe bill finds more savings by shifting some of the payments for food stamps from federal to state governments.\nRep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, said that, while lower income people will receive a modest tax break, they will end up behind when lost healthcare and nutrition benefits are factored. He said the experts don’t back Republican insistence that the bill will energize the nation’s economy.\n“The president is going to say how well economic development is going to be impacted, but experts say the numbers don’t indicate that,” Fields said. “These are not Democratic talking points. These are the Congressional Budget Office analysis.”\n“This bill increases energy costs by $400 per household, cedes hundreds of billions in clean energy investments and jobs to countries like China, and undermines our ability to compete in a global economy,” said Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans. “This is a full-blown assault on veterans, students, workers, the elderly, and every family that relies on a fair shot to get ahead. It’s a betrayal of our values and a dark day for economic justice.”\nMuch of the GOP opposition came from fiscal hawks fearful of adding to the national debt and had sought deeper spending cuts in Medicaid and other programs.\nThe bill is expected to add $3.3 trillion to the nation’s $36.2 trillion debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the arm of Congress charged with estimating the financial impact of legislation under consideration. Interest payments on the debt are getting close $1 trillion annually and are one of the federal government’s largest expenses.\nThe bill also includes language that allows Louisiana to receive a larger cut of federal offshore leases and production by raising the annual cap on offshore energy revenue sharing with Gulf states from $500 million to $650 million through 2034.\nThe bill also would require the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to hold no fewer than two lease sales every year for fifteen years in Gulf waters and eliminated the $200 tax stamp for short-barreled firearms.",
            "Senate works a tense overnight session as Republicans seek support for Trump&#8217;s big bill. Lisa Mascaro, Associated Press\nLisa Mascaro, Associated Press\nMary Clare Jalonick, Associated Press\nMary Clare Jalonick, Associated Press\nMatt Brown, Associated Press\nMatt Brown, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate slogged through a tense overnight session that dragged into Tuesday, with Republican leaders searching for ways to secure support for President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts while fending off proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.\nREAD MORE: Musk says he’ll work to primary members of Congress who vote for Trump’s big bill\nAn endgame appeared to be taking shape. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota spent the night reaching for last-minute agreements between those in his party worried the bill’s reductions to Medicaid will leave millions without care and his most conservative flank, which wants even steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts.\nVice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol, on hand to break a tie vote if needed.\nIt’s a pivotal moment for the Republicans, who have control of Congress and are racing to wrap up work with just days to go before Trump’s holiday deadline Friday. The 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” as it’s formally titled, has consumed Congress as its shared priority with the president.\nAt the same time House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled more potential problems ahead, warning the Senate package could run into trouble when it is sent back to the House for a final round of voting, as skeptical lawmakers are being called back to Washington ahead of Trump’s Fourth of July deadline.\nIn a midnight social media post urging them on, Trump called the bill “perhaps the greatest and most important of its kind.” Vice President JD Vance summed up his own series of posts, simply imploring senators to “Pass the bill.”\nWhat started as a routine, but laborious day of amendment voting, in a process called vote-a-rama, spiraled into an almost round-the-clock marathon as Republican leaders were buying time to shore up support.\nThe droning roll calls in the chamber belied the frenzied action to steady the bill. Grim-faced scenes played out on and off the Senate floor, and tempers flared.\nThe GOP leaders have no room to spare, with narrow majorities in both chambers. Thune can lose no more than three Republican senators, and already two — Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who warns people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who opposes raising the debt limit by $5 trillion — have indicated opposition.\nAttention quickly turned to key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have also wroked to stem the health care cuts, but also a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\nMurkowski in particular was the subject of the GOP leadership’s attention, as Thune and others sat beside her in conversation.\nThen all eyes were on Paul after he returned from a visit to Thune’s office with a stunning offer that could win his vote. He had suggested substantially lowering the debt ceiling, according to two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\nAnd on social media, billionaire Elon Musk was again lashing out at Republicans as “the PORKY PIG PARTY!!” for including the $5 trillion debt limit provision, which is needed to allow continued borrowing to pay the bills.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his side was working to show “how awful this is.”\n“Republicans are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular,” Schumer said as he walked the halls.\nA new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.\nFew Republicans appear fully satisfied as the final package emerges, in either the House or Senate.\nCollins had proposed bolstering the $25 billion proposed rural hospital fund to $50 billion, offset with a higher tax rate on those earning more than $25 million a year, but her amendment failed.\nWATCH: How proposed cuts to Medicaid could affect rural hospitals\nAnd Murkowski was trying to secure provisions to spare people in her state from some food stamp cuts, which appeared to be accepted, while she was also working to beef up federal reimbursements to hospitals in Alaska and others states, that failed to comply with parliamentary rules.\n“Radio silence,” Murkowski said when asked how she would vote.\nAt the same time, conservative Senate Republicans insisting on a vote on their plan for health care cuts, including Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, filed into Thune’s office for a near-midnight meeting.\nA few of the amendments from Democrats were winning support from a few Republicans, though almost none were passing.\nOne amendment was overwhelmingly approved, 99-1. It would strip a provision barring states from regulating artificial intelligence if they receive certain federal funding.\nAll told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Trump’s 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.\nWATCH: Breaking down Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ and its impact on the deficit and national debt\nThe Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.\nAdditionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.\nUnable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.\nDemocrats forced a full reading of the text, which took 16 hours, and they have a stream of amendments.\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern at the start of debate late Sunday about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Trump’s first term are now “current policy” and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.\nShe said that kind of “magic math” won’t fly with Americans trying to balance their own household books.\nAssociated Press writers Ali Swenson, Fatima Hussein, Michelle L.

Lisa Desjardins\nLisa Desjardins\nDoug Adams\nDoug Adams\nKyle Midura\nKyle Midura\nLeave your feedback\nThe so-called \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" overcame thin Republican majorities and weeks of tense negotiations, just meeting the president's self-imposed Independence Day deadline. Congressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins takes us through the policy and politics of the GOP's signature bill.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nWilliam Brangham:\nWelcome to the \"News Hour.\"\nNow missing just his signature, President Donald Trump's agenda will have the force of law tomorrow. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill overcame thin Republican majorities and weeks of tense negotiations just meeting the president's self-imposed Independence Day deadline.\nCongressional correspondent Lisa Desjardins takes us through the policy and politics of the Republican signature bill.\nRep. Mike Johnson (R-LA):\nThe yeas are 218, the nays are 214. The motion is adopted.\nLisa Desjardins:\nFor the GOP, a victory years in the making. House Republicans cheered after a long week of overnight and nail-biter votes ended historically, passage of what they named the One Big Beautiful Bill with some $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.4 trillion in spending cuts. Both are records, as is the $3.2 trillion the Congressional Budget Office says this could add to the deficit.\nRep. Mike Johnson:\nThis is the vote tally card. We're going to frame this one, OK?\nFor House Speaker Mike Johnson, a hard-fought moment to savor.\nMr. Speaker with One Big Beautiful Bill, we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before. And every American is going to benefit from that.\nPresident Trump was jubilant about his most sweeping legislative accomplishment.\nDonald Trump, President of the United States: We're sort of celebrating like the biggest bill of its kind ever signed. And it's going to make this country into a rocket ship.\nThe president was the closer in chief, pushing and pressuring the bill through, especially when it hit a wall last night. A House vote was frozen, as Republican opponents refused to let the bill advance.\nTrump posted shortly after midnight: \"This should be an easy yes-vote. Ridiculous.\" Then he was on the phone with the holdout, who had wanted more conservative social and fiscal policy. Not long after that, the vast majority flipped.\nA day earlier, Texas Republican Chip Roy and others had posted their lists of problems in the bill. But, today, from those opponents:\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-TN):\nDon't count out Trump. Daggum that guy, I wouldn't want to play poker with him.\nFull embrace of the bill.\nA day of go, many of you had major problems.\nRep. Tim Burchett:\nMajor problems. And that's why President Trump understood.\nAnd yet the bill did not change. Your vote did.\nYes, the timing of everything, and Trump understands that. And I believe that's why they called the vote last night, because that put everybody at the table, and they said, this is the deadline.\nRep. Greg Murphy (R-NC):\nI spoke with him. I spoke with the vice president, also, and after listening to them and thinking about it for a while, I went ahead and made the vote.\nPer multiple holdout members, Trump gave assurances about how he would implement the bill and tighten benefits, stepping up checks for possible undocumented immigrants.\nImmigration policy is also in the bill, $150 billion, including for a border wall and mass detention. It cuts billions in tax credits for wind and solar, and it makes the largest changes ever in the social safety net, Republican reforms of systems they don't trust, some cuts to SNAP benefits, and hundreds of billions cut in future Medicaid spending.\nEarlier this year, Trump pledged not to harm those eligible.\nDonald Trump:\nMedicaid, we're not going to do anything with that, other than, if we can find some abuse or waste, we will do something, but the people won't be affected. It'll only be more effective and better.\nBut the CBO concluded that, overall, nearly 12 million will lose health insurance because of the bill, including millions now on Medicaid.\nRep. James Clyburn (D-SC):\nIf cutting a trillion out of Medicaid is what we call progress, I'd like to see what failure is.\nThis was central to Democratic outcry over the bill, one they see as dangerous to those most vulnerable. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for nearly nine hours on the House floor, further delaying the vote and breaking a record for talk time in the chamber.\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY):\nNever in my time here in Congress have I experienced legislation that benefits so few people.\nBut Republicans are betting that their tax cuts spark massive economic growth. They will celebrate more tomorrow with a July 4 signing ceremony.\nNow, this was a messy, tricky process, house leadership and Senate leadership threading multiple needles, overnight votes, reading bills late. But, in the end, William, one Republican leadership source said, voters don't remember the process, they remember the result.\nLisa, this came down to those so-called fiscal hawks, the holdouts. What else do we know about why they changed their minds? What kinds of assurances did they get that got them to yes?\nIn the end, I think it really was just Trump pressure. But they told me a few things, one, that the president indicated to them that he was going to put new tariffs on solar and wind products all along the supply chain.\nNow, that's interesting because already there are very heavy tariffs, as we have reported on the show, on that. But they felt reassured because they were worried that the bill didn't do enough to cut solar and wind. The president said he's going to do more.\nNow, in addition, on undocumented immigrants, that's a limitation that was in the House bill cut from the Senate, the president told them that he plans to step up eligibility requirements or eligibility checks in things like Medicaid to make sure undocumented immigrants are not on the federal plan.\nNow, already there's a lot of eligibility checks, so we have to watch what that means.\nSo what does each party see about what happens next?\nRight.\nThis is fascinating because this bill really could drive the next political cycle entirely on its own. Republicans are going to start messaging that they believe the economy is being unleashed here, that this will be good for business, this will be good for individuals. They will be talking a lot about this.\nNow, Democrats, on the other hand, aren't worried about that message because they believe the effects of this bill, people will feel them in their own lives. People will be losing health care. They may be having more struggles, especially at those kinds of things.\nSo Democrats think, in the end, because they see this bill as dangerous, that it will benefit them. Both parties acknowledge that this will be something probably that will affect them on the ballot in 2026.\nAnd what do we know about the effects of this bill and when those might be felt by voters?\nThe biggest effect is one that actually no one will feel. The tax cuts in this bill largely mean that tax rates don't change at all. That's the most expensive part of this. So it's staving off a tax increase, but that is something that people should be aware of.\nNow, otherwise, there are some cuts already being felt like Medicaid cuts, even though technically they don't go into place until 2027, 2028. Today, there was a community hospital in Nebraska in the last 24 hours that came out and said this. This is community hospital in Curtis, Nebraska, writing that they feel that now because of anticipated Medicaid cuts and other financial problems they have had that they're going to close that clinic in Curtis.\nI spoke to officials in that town, this very small town. They said to me they only have a physical therapist in that town. The next closest medical facility is 40 to 50 minutes away. And they have a small college there as well. So they're concerned about this.\nOne other thing I want to talk about that we could see immediate effects from is the immigration money in this bill. We're talking about tens of billions of dollars for enforcement, detention, deportation. That's money that will go out almost immediately. And we know that the Trump administration wants to use it.\nLisa Desjardins, you have done such incredible work all week long for us, helping us stay up to speed.

            "Trump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan audit finds. 11:42\nrepublished\nTrump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan audit finds\nThe U.S. Capitol on Oct. 9, 2024. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON — The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released detailed analysis Wednesday showing Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion during the next decade.\nCBO projects that if enacted as written, the legislation would result in 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, a number that includes “1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.”\nThe score is the most up-to-date analysis by Congress’ official scorekeeper on how the sweeping tax and spending cuts package the House approved last month will impact the federal budget in the years ahead.\nRepublicans have been highly critical of the CBO’s assessment of the legislation’s real-world impacts, arguing that keeping tax rates as they are now, instead of letting them rise at the end of the year when the 2017 GOP tax law expires, will boost economic growth.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., lambasted the CBO during a press conference shortly after the report came out, arguing its economic growth projections haven’t been completely accurate.\n“This bill will actually reduce the deficit, if you recognize the historical economic growth that has always been there,” Scalise said. “To say you’re going to get 1.8% growth. At a minimum, we think you can get 2.5 to 4% growth. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, says over 4% economic growth. So I get that we’ve got to play by the rules of the referee, but the referee has been wrong.”\nDuring the last decade, U.S. growth only surpassed 3% during one year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nGross domestic product growth measured 2.5% in 2014, 2.9% in 2015, 1.8% in 2016, 2.5% in 2017, 3% in 2018, 2.6% in 2019, -2.2% in 2020 during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, 6.1% in 2021, 2.5% in 2022, 2.9% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024.\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought posted on social media that the CBO score “confirms what we knew about the bill at House passage.”\n“The bill REDUCES deficits by $1.4 trillion over ten years when you adjust for CBO’s one big gimmick–not using a realistic current policy baseline,” Vought wrote. “It includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings, the most in history. If you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture.”\nDisagreement over the ‘big beautiful bill’\nGOP lawmakers have also sought to brush aside criticism from some of their own members, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who both argue the legislation must cut spending more to reduce the federal deficit in the long run.\nBillionaire and former Trump administration staffer Elon Musk has also become increasingly vocal about his opposition to the package, writing on social media this week that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”\nThe House voted mostly along party lines in May to send the sweeping spending and tax cuts package to the Senate, which is expected to debate and amend the legislation in the weeks ahead.\nCBO’s analysis will likely inform some of that conversation, and help senators better understand how the policy changes proposed by their House colleagues would affect state government budgets and the communities they represent.\nThe CBO previously shared analysis of each of the 11 bills that make up the package, but those didn’t reflect several changes GOP House leaders made just hours before the floor vote in that chamber.\nUpdated numbers\nThe updated projections show Republicans’ plan to extend the 2017 tax law and make other tweaks to tax policy would increase the deficit by $3.754 trillion during the next decade. That increase to the deficit caused by the tax changes, which CBO has also found would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners, would be partly offset by spending reductions on certain programs.\nThe Armed Services Committee’s bill would increase deficits by $144 billion, more than the $100 billion ceiling Republicans envisioned in the budget outline that was supposed to set guardrails on the package. Homeland Security’s provisions would increase deficits by $79 billion. And the Judiciary Committee’s language would increase deficits by $9 billion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe section of the package drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which would make substantial changes to Medicaid and several other programs within the panel’s jurisdiction, would decrease spending by $1.086 trillion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe panel’s bill has four subcategories: energy, environment, communications and health. The health provisions, which include substantial changes to Medicaid, would reduce federal spending by $902 billion between 2025 and 2034.\nLanguage barring Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the state-federal health program would reduce federal spending by $2.6 billion during the next decade.\nRequiring some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service or attend educational programs for at least 80 hours a month would reduce federal spending by $344 billion during the next 10 years.\nBlocking any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood would cut federal costs by $261 million during the 10-year budget window. Federal law already bars health care programs like Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or it endangers the life of the woman.\nSeparate analysis from CBO, released later Wednesday, projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid because of the policy changes laid out in the House GOP bill. Another 2.3 million would lose access to health insurance due to changes to tax policy and 1.3 million people would no longer be able to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\nCBO estimates that about 500,000 people would be impacted by interactions among the various health care policy changes. That number, subtracted from the numbers of those who would lose access, leads to a total of 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034.\nDemocratic criticism\nEnergy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a statement that it’s “shocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national (deficit).\n“The truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn’t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.”\nThe Agriculture Committee’s provisions, including pushing off some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states, would reduce federal spending by $238 billion during the next decade.\nThe Education and Workforce Committee’s language would decrease federal spending by $349 billion. The Financial Services section of the package would reduce federal spending by $5 billion. Natural Resources would lower spending by $18 billion. And Transportation and Infrastructure would reduce spending by nearly $37 billion.\nThe Oversight and Government Reform bill would decrease spending by $12 billion, significantly less than the minimum of $50 billion the panel was supposed to cut under the reconciliation instructions included in the budget resolution.\nAriana Figueroa contributed to this report.\nLast updated 2:24 p.m., Jun. 4, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

            "What's in the latest version of Trump's big bill moving through the Senate. What's in the latest version of Trump's big bill moving through the Senate\nAt some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations\nWASHINGTON -- Republicans are inching closer to getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final Senate vote likely late Monday or early Tuesday.\nAt some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.\nDemocrats are united against the legislation and were offering scores of amendments to alter it Monday as the Senate slogged through what is known as a vote-a-rama. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, with each receiving a vote. Once the bill clears the Senate, it would have to pass the House before Trump can sign it into law.\nHere's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.\nRepublicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.\nThe existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.\nIt would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.\nA cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.\nThere are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.\nThe wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.\nMiddle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.\nThe bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.\nMoney would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.\nThe homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.\nTo help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.\nFor the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system.

Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”\nUnder the bill, a tax credit that subsidizes the production of electricity would be eliminated for any wind and solar plant not plugged into the grid by the end of 2027.

Trump tax bill would widen deficits by $2.8T after factoring in economic impacts, CBO says\nPresident Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after factoring in other economic effects\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s tax cuts package would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after including other economic effects, according to a fuller analysis of the House-passed measure released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe report, produced by the nonpartisan CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, factors in expected debt service costs and finds that the bill would increase interest rates and boost interest payments on the baseline projection of federal debt by $441 billion.\nThe analysis comes at a crucial moment as Trump is pushing the GOP-led Congress to act on what he calls his “big, beautiful bill.\" It passed the House last month on a party-line vote, and now faces revisions in the Senate. Vice President JD Vance urged Senate Republicans during a private lunch meeting Tuesday to send the final package to the president's desk.\n“We're excited to get this bill out,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune afterward.\nTuesday’s report uses dynamic analysis by estimating the budgetary impact of the tax bill by considering how changes in the economy might affect revenues and spending. This is in contrast to static scoring, which presumes all other economic factors stay constant.\nThe CBO released its static scoring analysis earlier this month, estimating that Trump’s bill would unleash trillions in tax cuts and slash spending, but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance.\nRepublicans have repeatedly argued that a more dynamic scoring model would more accurately show how cutting taxes would spur economic growth — essentially overcoming any lost revenue to the federal government.\nBut the larger deficit numbers in the new analysis gave Democrats, who are unified against the big bill, fresh arguments for challenging the GOP position that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves.\n“The Republican claim that this bill does not add to the debt or deficit is laughable, and the proof is in the numbers,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.\n“The cost of these tax giveaways for billionaires, even when considering economic growth, will add even more to the debt than we previously expected,” he said.\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Tuesday on social media that considering the new dynamic analysis, “It’s not only not paying for all of itself, it’s not paying for any of itself.”\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO, saying the organization isn’t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create.\nAt the Capitol, Mehmet Oz, who heads up the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and joined Vance at the GOP Senate lunch, challenged CBO's findings when asked about its estimate that the bill would leave 10.9 million more people without health care, largely from new work requirements.\n“What will an American do if they’re given the option of trying to get a job or an education or volunteering their community — having some engagement — or losing their Medicaid insurance coverage?” Oz asked. “I have more confidence in the American people than has been given to them by some of these analyzing organizations.”\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee unveiled their proposal Monday for deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making Trump’s tax breaks more permanent in their draft for the big bill.\nThe Senate's version of the package also enhances Trump’s proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.\nThe proposals from Senate Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.\nBessent said Tuesday that the Senate Republican proposal for the tax cuts bill “will deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.”\n“We look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump’s desk,” he said in a news release.\nWhile the House-passed bill exempted parents with dependents from the new Medicaid work requirements, the Senate’s version broadened the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.\nThe work requirements “demonstrate that you are trying your hardest to help this country be greater,” Oz said. “By doing that, you earn the right to be on Medicaid.”\nThe CBO separately released another analysis on the tax bill last week, including a look at how the measure would affect households based on income distribution. It estimates the bill would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually.",

            "What’s in Trump’s big, beautiful bill? Tax cuts, deportations and more. The Republican-led Senate is on a final sprint to pass the one big beautiful bill, a sprawling piece of legislation that will enact Donald Trump’s tax and spending priorities. Lawmakers from both parties are offering last-minute amendments ahead of a final vote on passage that could come Tuesday, after which the legislation will return to the House of Representatives, which passed their version of the bill last month.\nExtend big tax cuts After taking office in 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered taxes and increased the standard deduction for all taxpayers, but generally benefited high earners more than most. Those provisions are set to expire after this year, but the big, beautiful bill makes them permanent, while increasing the standard deduction by $1,000 for individuals, $1,500 for heads of households and $2,000 for married couples, albeit only through 2028.\nCutting tax on tips or overtime The bill has an array of new tax write-offs – but only while Trump is president. Several of the new exemptions stem from promises Trump made while campaigning last year. Taxpayers will be able to write off income from tips and overtime, and interest made on loans to purchase cars assembled in the United States. People aged 65 and over are eligible for an additional deduction of $6,000, provided their adjusted gross income does not exceed $75,000 for single filers or $150,000 for couples. But all of these incentives expire at the end of 2028, right before Trump’s term as president ends.\nMoney for mass deportations and a border wall As part of Trump’s plan to remove undocumented immigrants from the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will receive $45bn for detention facilities, $14bn for deportation operations and billions of dollars more to hire an additional 10,000 new agents by 2029. More than $50bn is allocated for the construction of new border fortifications, which will probably include a wall along the border with Mexico.\nSlashing Medicaid and food stamps Republicans have attempted to cut down on the bill’s cost by slashing two major federal safety net programs: Medicaid, which provides healthcare to poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which helps people afford groceries. Both are in for funding cuts, as well as new work requirements. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the Medicaid changes could cost as many as 10.6 million people their healthcare, and about eight million people, or one in five recipients, their Snap benefits.\nCuts to green energy The bill will phase out many tax incentives created by Congress during Joe Biden’s presidency meant to encourage consumers and businesses to use electric vehicles and other clean energy technology. Credits for cleaner cars will end this year, as will subsidies for Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances. Wind and solar energy projects are targeted with a new excise tax that the American Clean Power Association, an industry group, estimates would hike consumer electricity rates by between 8% and 10%, and cost businesses between $4bn and $7bn by 2036. However, the tax may be modified as part of the ongoing amendment process.\nState and local tax relief (Salt) One of the thorniest issues the bill addresses is how much relief to provide from state and local taxes (Salt), which many Americans must also pay in addition to their federal tax. Several House Republicans representing districts in Democrat-led states withheld their support from the bill until the Salt deductibility cap was raised from $10,000 to $40,000, but Senate Republicans made clear they would change that. The Senate’s version keeps the $40,000 cap, but only through 2028.\nRaising the debt ceiling The bill will increase the US government’s authority to borrow, known as the debt limit, by $5tn. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has predicted the government will hit the limit by August, at which point it could default on its debt and spark a financial crisis.\nMore benefits for the rich than the poor Wealthier taxpayers appear set to receive more benefits from this bill than poorer ones, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University. Taxpayers in the lowest income quintile will see a 2.5% decrease in their incomes, largely due to the Snap and Medicaid cuts, while the highest earners will see their incomes grow by 2.4%, the Budget Lab estimated. The impact could change based on what amendments the Senate adopts.\nA huge price tag Despite the GOP’s attempts to use the bill as a vehicle to rein in government spending, the bill would increase the deficit by $3.3tn through 2034, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Most of that price tag is the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The heavy budgetary impact could complicate the bill’s chances of passing the House, where fiscal hardliners have demanded budget deficit reductions.",
            "New tax break for auto loans could save some buyers thousands of dollars. But will it boost sales?. New tax break for auto loans could save some buyers thousands of dollars. But will it boost sales?\nThe new tax law signed by President Donald Trump creates a federal tax deduction for interest on auto loans\nMillions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.\nThe new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.\nHere are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:\nTrump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and “stimulate massive domestic auto production.”\nThe idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.\nThe law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles.

But will it boost sales?\nMillions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump’s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.\nThe new tax break will be available even to people who don’t itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used.

It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.\nThe tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns.

            "Trump’s tax law will mostly benefit the rich, while leaving poorer Americans with less, CBO says. By STEPHEN GROVES, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law will result in less income for the poorest Americans while sending money to the richest, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported Monday.\nThe CBO estimates that the 10% of poorest Americans will lose roughly $1,200 a year as they experience restrictions on government programs like Medicaid and food assistance, while the richest 10% of Americans will see their income increase by $13,600 from tax cuts. Overall, American households will see more income from the tax cuts in the legislation, including middle income households, but the largest benefit will go to the top 10% of earners.\nThe CBO’s report comes as lawmakers are away from Washington, many taking their messages about the bill to voters. Republicans muscled the legislation — deemed “the big, beautiful bill” by Trump — through Congress in July. Democrats all vehemently opposed the legislation, warning that its tax cuts and spending priorities would come at the expense of vital government aid programs and a ballooning national debt.\n“This really is a big, beautiful bill for billionaires, but for the poor and the working class in this country, you are actually poorer,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, in an MSNBC interview on Monday.\nChanges to eligibility for government food assistance under the law will impact millions of Americans, the CBO found. Roughly 2.4 million people won’t be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program under new work requirements for many recipients. Low-income Americans could also see their income reduced through further restrictions on food aid and other types of assistance included in the law.\nAlready, more than 10 million Americans are expected to be without health insurance by 2034 due to changes to Medicaid under the law.\nRepublicans were eager to sell the upsides of the legislation — arguing that the tax cuts will spur economic growth — while they are on a monthlong summer break from Washington. But those who have held townhalls in their home districts have often been greeted by an earful from voters and activists.\n“Tax the rich,” the crowd in Lincoln, Neb. chanted last week as Republican Rep. Michael Flood attempted to defend the bill.\nStill, Trump has been undeterred.\n“President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is putting America First like never before, delivering huge savings for hardworking families, boosting our economy, and securing our borders,” said White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson in a statement last week.",
            "How Trump&#8217;s big bill could affect women, children and LGBTQ+ Americans. Amanda Becker, The 19th\nAmanda Becker, The 19th\nLeave your feedback\nThis article was originally published by The 19th.\nAfter more than 24 hours of deliberations, the U.S. Senate approved a sweeping package of tax cuts Tuesday that largely benefit the wealthy, financed by what advocates call “historic” cuts to government health insurance and nutrition programs that serve lower-income Americans.\nPresident Donald Trump wanted it all in “one, big, beautiful bill,” and Republicans are aiming to get it to the president ahead of the July 4 holiday. The package has now returned to the House, which must approve the same version of the legislation after passing a different version in May.\nWATCH: What’s in the version of Trump’s bill passed by the Senate and its chances in the House\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said over the weekend that the Senate package is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade and lead to nearly 12 million Americans losing health care coverage.\nThe largest spending cuts in the Senate version come from Medicaid, the popular government health insurance program that covers more than 70 million lower-income Americans.\nWhen the bill arrived in the Senate, the Medicaid cuts passed by the House were a major sticking point for a handful of GOP senators, including Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Though the Medicaid cuts in the Senate version are even more severe than in the House iteration, Hawley quickly said he would vote for them and Murkowski secured the addition of several provisions specific to Alaskans, though some were stripped out because they did not comply with parliamentary rules.\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\nOver the weekend, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he opposed the bill over concerns about how the Medicaid cuts would impact his state; Trump promised to primary him and Tillis said instead he would not seek reelection. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against the package due to deficit concerns. Collins remained opposed, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast the tie-breaking vote.\nDemocrats were largely on the sidelines because Republicans in the Senate used a process called reconciliation, which allows the majority party to bypass the 60-vote filibuster requirement and approve legislation by a simple majority vote. There are 53 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate.\nIt has become common for both parties to take advantage of reconciliation when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Republicans used reconciliation to enact the 2017 Trump tax cuts that they are now attempting to renew. Democrats used it to enact President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus bill and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nHere are the programs serving women, children and LGBTQ+ Americans that the tax bill would change:\nThe Senate legislation would cut federal spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for low-income infants and children by more than $1 trillion over the next decade — an 18% larger cut than the House-approved version, according to Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.\nThe federal-state Medicaid health insurance program covers more than 40% of all births in the country, and about 37% of those enrolled are children. Nationally, CHIP covers about 7 million children and several hundred thousand pregnant people.\nREAD MORE: A closer look at who relies on Medicaid\nLike the legislation approved by the House, the Senate package would cut Medicaid spending in part by imposing a strict 80-hours-a-month work requirement for adults without children or disabilities — this change must be implemented by the end of 2026, after the midterm elections, but states have the option of doing it sooner. Three million Americans enrolled in Medicaid report that they are unable to work due to caregiving responsibilities, according to an AARP analysis. The 19th has reported on how these stepped-up work requirements would disproportionately impact middle-aged and older women.\nThe Senate bill would create new limits on Medicaid coverage for immigrants in the country legally. It would also require states to charge Medicaid recipients above the poverty line for co–payments for some health care.\nA provision that would have prohibited Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for transgender people — minors and adults — was stripped out by the Senate parliamentarian. But the Senate parliamentarian approved a provision that would prevent Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health care clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for the provision of non-abortion care.\nSome of the largest savings would come from the stepped-up work requirements and the reduction in the amount that states are able to tax Medicaid providers, impacting Medicaid expansions in as many as 22 states, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.\nThe Senate legislation would also trigger the rollback of Medicaid expansions in some states that have passed laws that end the expansion if the federal government changes the federal-state funding formula.\nLike the package passed by House Republicans, the Senate version would require more SNAP recipients in their 50s and 60s to work and provide fewer exemptions for parents.\nThe proposal would lower the age at which work requirements end by a decade, to 54. Right now, parents with dependent children under 18 are exempt from working; the House bill lowered that age to 7 but the Senate version would only lower the age to 14.\nWATCH: Provision in GOP budget bill puts millions at risk of losing SNAP benefits\nAdditionally, the Senate legislation would shift some SNAP costs to states — since its inception, SNAP benefits have been fully funded by the federal government.\nUnder the Senate’s SNAP proposal, the federal government would continue to fund SNAP for states that have a payment error rate below 6%, but starting in 2028, states with error rates above that would have to contribute 5% to 15% of the cost. Alaska and Hawaii would receive a temporary exemption from the cost-sharing requirement.\nChanges to SNAP could also affect school nutrition programs, as many students qualify for free meals based on whether they and their families are eligible for food stamps.\nThe Senate version would permanently increase the child tax credit to $2,200 from $2,000. The House tax bill approved in May would increase the amount of the child tax credit to $2,500, but only through 2028, the last year of Trump’s term. The tax credit would then drop back down and be indexed to inflation.\nThe Senate version tweaks a provision in the House-approved version that would require both of a child’s parents to have a Social Security number to access the credit, even if the child also has a Social Security number. The Senate version requires only one parent to have a Social Security number to claim the credit.\nBoth versions cap the refundable portion of the child tax credit, limiting the ability of the country’s lowest-income parents to access the credit.\nYour donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more"

            "Judge extends pause on order invalidating Trump’s tariffs. Judge extends pause on order invalidating Trump’s tariffs\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., extended a pause on his order invalidating the bulk of President Trump’s tariffs until an appeals court can resolve the case.\nU.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras had already agreed to put his ruling on hold for two weeks when he issued it, but Tuesday’s extension lasts indefinitely until the appeals court rules.\nIt’s the latest development in what has been a whirlwind week for the legal battle surrounding Trump’s tariffs. Two federal courts found Trump’s use of an emergency law to justify tariffs unlawful, but neither ruling is currently in effect.\nIn response to a lawsuit filed by two education businesses, Contreras on Thursday invalidated Trump’s reciprocal “Liberation Day” tariffs and those he recently imposed on China that cited fentanyl trafficking.\nThe ruling landed hours after the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked those tariffs and ones Trump imposed on Canada and Mexico. That ruling came in response to suits filed by another group of businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states.\nThe Trump administration quickly brought the legal battle to the appeals courts and asked to immediately halt the injunctions, warning that allowing them to take effect would curtail Trump’s leverage to make trade deals with other countries.\nThe two appeals are taking place in separate courts.\nIn the case decided by the trade court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit quickly agreed to pause the ruling until the next stage of the appeal.\nContreras’s ruling heads to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet intervened. But noting the Federal Circuit’s pause, Contreras went ahead and put his decision on hold indefinitely.\n“The Court acknowledged the national security and foreign policy concerns raised by Defendants but determined that those consequences would flow, if at all, from the” trade court’s order, Contreras wrote.\n“That order has now been stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A stay in this action is therefore appropriate to protect the President’s ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security,” Contreras, an appointee of former President Obama, continued.\nThe cases are just some of the legal challenges to Trump’s tariffs.\nBut federal judges in California, Montana and Florida have declined to consider other lawsuits filed in their courts, telling plaintiffs they instead need to bring their case before the trade court.\nU.S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley, an appointee of former President Biden who serves in San Francisco, did so on Tuesday and dismissed a lawsuit filed by California and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.",

            "Gujarat government sanctions new bridge parallel to collapsed structure in Vadodara. AHMEDABAD: Days after the Mahisagar river bridge collapse tragedy in Vadodara district, the Gujarat government has approved the construction of a parallel two-lane bridge and approved Rs 212 crore for the project-related work.\nSeveral vehicles plunged into the Mahisagar river after a segment of the 40-year-old bridge near Gambhira village, connecting Anand and Vadodara districts, collapsed on July 9.\nThe death toll rose to 20 on Friday, while the search for a missing person continues, officials said on Sunday.\nThe old bridge near Gambhira village was a key link between central Gujarat and Saurashtra.\nChief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Sunday granted administrative approval to the Roads and Buildings Department for the construction of a new bridge near Mujpur connecting Vadodara and Anand districts.\nThe government has set a target to build the new structure in 18 months and the tendering process has been initiated, an official release stated.\nA detailed project report was recently prepared by the R&B Department after a survey.\n\"Following the unfortunate collapse of the existing bridge, which disrupted connectivity between central Gujarat and Saurashtra and posed challenges for local commuters and students, the chief minister swiftly approved this new project,\" it said.\nR&B Department's superintending engineer NV Rathva said the existing two-lane Mujpur approach road will be expanded to four lanes and widened to seven metres.\nA 4.2 km stretch from the highway to the bridge will also be expanded to four lanes.\n\"The chief minister has approved administrative sanction of Rs 212 crore for these works,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the operation to trace a missing man continued in the Mahisagar river, officials said.\nThe rescue teams were conducting searches with rubber boats and other necessary equipment, he said, adding the wreckage of the small vehicles was also salvaged.",
            "'A huge explosion-like sound' - Survivors recall moment India bridge collapsed. 'A huge explosion-like sound' - Survivors recall moment India bridge collapsed\nSurvivors of a bridge collapse in India's Gujarat state on Wednesday that killed at least 15 people have said that they initially thought it was an explosion or earthquake.\nThe cause of the collapse is still to be ascertained, and investigations are under way according to state government officials.\nAnwarbhai, who was driving a van which had two other passengers, was on the bridge on Wednesday morning when he heard a deafening crack - a section of the bridge behind him had collapsed into the Mahisagar river, taking some vehicles along with it.\n\"There was a huge explosion-like sound and part of the bridge collapsed behind us. Our van also started rolling backwards so we quickly jumped out,\" he told BBC Gujarati.\nThe 40-year-old bridge connected Vadodara district with central Gujarat and usually saw a lot of traffic.\nDramatic visuals after the collapse showed a truck teetering dangerously from the edge of the broken bridge - it was later moved to safety. But other vehicles, including lorries, cars and a tuktuk, plunged into the water.\nAt least four people are still missing and search operations are under way.\n\"Our priority is to check the area quickly and retrieve both bodies and any survivors,\" Surender Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, told news agency ANI.\nSonalben Padhiyar was the only survivor among her family members after the car she was travelling in fell into the river.\nRecounting the terrifying moments, Ms Padhiyar told the Indian Express newspaper that she was sitting in the back when the car fell into the river headfirst.\nA video of her, visibly distressed and shouting for someone to save her son, has since gone viral. She later told ANI that she screamed for a long time before help arrived. She lost six family members.\nDilipsinh Padhiyar, another survivor (not related to Ms Padhiyar), was returning home from a night shift on his two-wheeler when the accident took place.\n\"Traffic was moving as usual,\" he told the Indian Express.\nHe said he had barely crossed 100m on the bridge when he felt a vibration before the structure gave way.\n\"I found myself falling into the river,\" he said.\nMr Padhiyar suffered injuries but managed to hold on to a metal rod and stay afloat until local fishermen arrived to help.\nEyewitnesses said the collapse felt like an earthquake, shaking the ground and sending multiple vehicles crashing into the river.\nJairaj Singh, one of the locals who rushed to the scene, told BBC Gujarati he was alerted by a phone call from a friend.\n\"As soon as I heard, I rushed over,\" he said. \"We began pulling out vehicles with ropes. People from the area came together to help.\"\nThe collapse has set off a political row, with locals saying they had often complained about its poor condition.\nRavibhai, who lives in the area, told BBC Gujarati that the bridge would often shake when heavy vehicles drove on it.\nAbhesinh Parmar, a local council chief from a village near the bridge, said it was in a \"dilapidated\" condition and \"had potholes everywhere\".\n\"Rods could be seen sticking out of the structure. We complained many times, but no action was taken,\" he alleged.\nRushikesh Patel, a spokesperson for the Gujarat government, denied this, saying that the bridge was inspected and repaired at regular intervals.\n\"Recently, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel had approved dismantling the existing bridge and constructing a new one. We were set to issue a tender soon,\" he said.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from Gujarat, has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and announced compensation.\nWednesday's collapse is among a series of deadly accidents linked to ageing and poorly maintained public infrastructure in India.\nIn 2022, around 135 people were killed when a 137-year-old suspension bridge in Gujarat's Morbi town collapsed into a river. The bridge, a popular tourist attraction, had reopened for visitors just days earlier following repairs.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",
            "Crores spent, but will Chennai's roads ever be people-friendly?. Walking, Hippocrates said, is man's best medicine. But think again if you have decided to hit the roads in Chennai for your daily dose.\nEven the area around Pondy Bazaar, where the Smart City project has come up, is not immune from the woes plaguing pedestrians in the city. Ask Jaysingh.\nEvery evening, the 66-year-old laces up his sandals and steps out for a walk down Usman Road to meet his friends at Pondy Bazaar—a routine he has followed since retiring from the railways a decade ago. A mighty challenge confronts the senior citizen on each occasion.\nThe footpath he once strolled along with ease now barely exists. It's buried under plastic stools and mannequin legs. There are also the motorbikes that dart across like they own the sidewalk. Agility and nimbleness of the highest order is demanded, and every time.\nThen again, Jaysingh at least has the luxury of having a sidewalk. These are a rarity for others.\n\"Pondy Bazaar and a few other posh areas in the city have well-maintained footpaths. However, in my area, there are no separate sidewalks. The construction of sidewalks could reduce accidents involving pedestrians,\" a daily commuter from Triplicane complained to The New Indian Express.\nThe talk of accidents brings the risks involved in crossing over into focus, even at intersections where there are signals.\n\"It's quite dangerous. I have had several narrow misses from being hit by cars that jump the signal near Adyar junction. It's easier to walk on these roads in the night since there is less traffic,\" said Vishaka, a resident of Adyar.\n\"Damaged footpaths make things worse, especially for elderly citizens who often struggle or sometimes fall on these paths,\" she added.\nRajeev, a businessman from Porur, highlighted how money spent to address the problems too is of little help on many occasions.\n\"Although there is a lot of development happening when it comes to city roads, maintenance is lacking. The authorities have to look into this aspect. There should also be civic sense among the citizens,\" he said.\nIndeed, projects worth several crores of rupees have been okayed to improve the roads and make them pedestrian-friendly, but commuting, particularly for the poor, continues to be difficult.\nIn fact, the Greater Chennai Corporation, on paper, is said to maintain 471 bus route roads over a length of 387 km and 34,640 interior roads over a length of 5,270.33 km.\nBut the warmth Singara Chennai shows to people from all walks of life and regions is certainly not to be found on its roads.\nThe accessibility challenge\nIt doesn't help that authorities entrusted with the job of finding a solution to the city's roads problem have overlooked the need to make pedestrian infrastructure accessible to all.\nWhile the Chennai Metro—with its Braille station maps, tactile paths, hearing induction loops and wheelchair-accessible spaces across stations— and the Metropolitan Transport Corporation—with its low-floor buses—promote accessibility, you walk into a less-sensitive world once you deboard public transport.\nIf any footpaths exist, they are far from accessible.\n“One of the better examples in the city is Marina Beach, which is a levelled, wide space, mostly free of disruptions, but this is not the case elsewhere in the city. Power cables, bollards, police booths and encroachments by shops and restaurants all act as disruptions to an accessible footpath,” said Satish Kumar, a member of the Disability Rights Alliance and a full-time automated wheelchair user.\nHe added that even if ramps are provided in some bus stops, they are often steep, putting users in need of supported walking in a fix. They are forced to use the road and exposed to the risks of high-speed traffic.\n\"If the GCC takes up our accessibility concerns in their new project to build 200 km of footpaths at Rs 200 crore, it will be very helpful without needing to make any changes in the future. Any infrastructure built for PwDs usually results in benefiting the society at large,\" he went on to add.\nNumbers Chennai cannot be proud of\nWith such being the challenges, it comes as no surprise that pedestrian fatalities in Tamil Nadu have increased by 20-40 per cent.\nThis is according to a study conducted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), which cited the state government's Road Accidents Report 2019-'23. The rise in the numbers in Chennai might be steeper.\n\"In Chennai, violations on the street, such as jumping signals and wrong-side driving, are rampant. Accidents involving pedestrians using footpaths are also common when two-wheelers use footpaths to dodge traffic. This brings in the need for efficient enforcement from the city corporation and the traffic police,\" said AV Venugopal, Programme Manager for Healthy Streets at the ITDP.\nHe added that pedestrian crossings are where accidents often happen.\n\"In many instances, signals across Chennai have been removed in favour of U-turns. A study found that 23% of road accidents involving pedestrians in Hyderabad occurred at U-turns. In Tamil Nadu, where 2/3rd of the population are walking, cycling or using public transportation, doesn't it make sense to keep them in mind when these spaces are designed?\" he asked.\nAnother villain in the mix is the ongoing metro construction in all areas of the city.\nThe \"Inconvenience today for a better tomorrow\" approach of the Chennai Metro Rail Project has unleashed chaos of a high order across the city daily.\nIn many places, such as the OMR (Rajiv Gandhi IT Expressway), existing pedestrian infrastructure, such as Foot Overbridges (FOBs) to cross the six-lane highway, has been brought down to facilitate metro construction, leaving commuters in the lurch.\nService roads have also been merged with regular roads at many places to broaden them and make way for vehicles. It has only served to add to the woes.\nSowmya Kannan, a researcher for sustainable transportation with Citizen, Consumer and Civic Action Group (CAG), said, \"Removal of pedestrian infrastructure for the construction of a public transport project is a negative development. There are existing Indian Road Congress norms that need to be employed to avoid metro construction hurdles. Further, at-grade crossings such as traffic signals should be in place to facilitate smoother yet safer movement of pedestrians.\"\nVenugopal also agrees.\n\"Following existing SOPs, where vehicles are re-routed during metro or other development projects, pedestrians also need to be provided barricaded covered spaces with adequate signage, which costs very little in an already multi-crore project,\" he added, underlining that this needs to be a priority before mishaps occur.\nA grand dream that is now in tatters?\nThe nightmarish state of Chennai's roads has come to be despite the Chennai Corporation (now known as the Greater Chennai Corporation or GCC) being the first in India to adopt a Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) policy over ten years ago. The aim of the policy was to promote walkability and cycling within Chennai city.\nA budgetary allocation of 60% from the transport budget towards constructing and maintaining infrastructure to bring this dream to fruition had been recommended.\nAnd then there was that grand desire—to reduce the number of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities on Chennai roads to zero by 2018, as per an official document.\nWhat has been achieved?\n\"Fast forward, today we have over 170 km of streets with footpaths developed between 2014 and 2019. The areas include Harrington Road, Police Commissioner Office Road, Egmore, Binny Road, NSC Bose Road and West Avenue. Further, the Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza, a stretch of 800 metres, was inaugurated as a model people-friendly space, while keeping the commercial nature of the street intact,\" said Venugopal.\nThe Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza was developed at a cost of Rs 39.86 crore.\nThe ideal pedestrian-friendly stretch?\nOften touted as the Non-Motorised Transport policy ideal, the Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza, from Panagal Park to Thanikachalam Road Signal, was launched in 2019, transforming a two-way shopping street to a one-way street, prioritising pedestrians.\n\"As per an impact assessment we conducted, the feedback from citizens has been positive, and the need to create more footpaths has led to the recent budget announcement to develop 200 km of footpaths across the city. A walk through the plaza in the evening reflects a rise in sales, land value, and a sense of safety. Compared to the earlier stretch choked with vehicles, the current space is thriving,\" Venugopal added.\nThat said, not all users of this stretch, including Jaisingh, think that the implementation and maintenance have been flawless.\n\"Even though the government has spent crores to build Pondy Bazaar as a pedestrian-friendly space, there is a lack of civic sense needed for the space. The area is often littered and cars are parked in no-parking zones, even after the government has spent huge amounts to build the Multi-Level Car Parking (MLCP) facility here,\" he said.\n\"In the adjoining Ranganathan Street and Usman Road, walking has become chaotic, due to shops encroaching on the footpath. Even after repeated complaints on the GCC helpline, no action has been taken to remove these encroachments. The issue is further exacerbated by low-lying utility cables,\" he added.\nCAG's Sowmya, too, agrees. \"While it is pedestrian-friendly, street vendors were relocated to a complex built by the GCC. The lack of visibility of this complex has reduced pedestrian footfall, leading to dwindling sales for them. Further, due to a lack of enforcement, there are concerns with parking as well. Lesser street parking and disuse of the Multi Level Car Parking have transferred the burden of car parking to nearby residential areas.\"\nShe added that Chennai Unified Metropolitan Authority's upcoming parking policy could address these woes.\nThe dream of building 'Complete Streets'\nThe arrival of the Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza led to the birth of the Complete Streets Project, another experiment devoted to a better tomorrow.\nThe project aims to build city streets that have a lifespan of at least 30 years. By design, it prioritises walking, cycling and public transport use while being inclusive spaces for women, children, the elderly and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).\nCharacteristics of the Complete Street include wide and continuous footpaths, pedestrian crossings, conveniently designed bus stops, seating arrangements, ramps for accessibility, designated on-street parking, organised street vending and scaled carriageways.\nThese stretches will have dedicated ducts underground for electricity lines, telecommunication cables and gas pipelines and redesigned stormwater drains.\n\"The Complete Streets Project was launched in 2020 under the World Bank Chennai City Partnership Project, which is currently underway at key stretches,\" Venugopal said.\nWorks are currently progressing under this project, bringing together various departments that manage utilities, sewage, and stormwater drains, so that these roads are not dug up soon.\nThe roads Complete Streets is targetting include MC Road, Royapuram, Race Course Road, Guindy, and Tollgate Road, Thiruvottriyur.\nKNK Road in Nungambakkam, taken up for development under the Complete Streets Project, is expected to be completed by August 25, 2025.\nSimilarly, the MC Road in Royapuram should be completed by December 2025, the Race Course Road, Guindy by May 2026 and Tollgate Road in Thiruvottriyur by May 2026.\nThe Harrington Road idyll and the problem it's facing\nAnother attempt at a solution that needs to be highlighted in the mostly well-maintained, wide pavements of Harrington Road in Chetpet.\nThe project, although not an official Complete Streets or NMT project, was an initiative of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), which took inputs from residents of the Harrington Road Association.\nThe maintenance of this stretch is currently undertaken by Urbaser, a private contractor under the civic body. The road follows many principles of Complete Streets, such as spacing for utility cables and has agreed on a compromise when it comes to the width of the road to accommodate a wider pavement.\nSuhasini, a member of the Harrington Road Association, said, \"People outside the association never understood the rationale behind wide pavements. This was done keeping in mind the numerous schools here. Further, we also kept the disabled in mind when submitting our designs to the GCC. Kerbside parking was also incorporated, but has turned out to be insufficient and paid parking is not feasible, as it is a residential street.\"\nHowever, she added that maintenance of the road is turning out to be a hassle.\n\"Two-wheelers parking and riding along the footpath have forced us to place plant pots between the bollards. Further, granite slabs on the footpath are often damaged by the electricity board when they undertake various repairs, putting pedestrians at risk,\" she said.\nThe road ahead\nWhat does the future then have in store for the city?\nWhile the Complete Streets projects are set to change a few prominent localities, awaiting such a change to sweep across Chennai will take ages.\n\"Urban planners need to have an empathy-based approach as opposed to a vehicle-centric approach in designing public spaces. We also need to keep in mind those who do not have the privilege to walk around freely, like senior citizens or Persons with Disabilities, to enhance the pedestrian experience,\" said Gayatri, who visits the city often.\nThe GCC is taking efforts to maintain the existing 179 km of footpaths in the city and also develop new specialised footpaths under the recently implemented Chennai Comprehensive Mobility Plan.\n\"Presently, we are developing footpaths in school corridors, namely, Avvai Shanmugham Salai, Conran Smith Road and Padmavati Salai, keeping the safety of students in mind,\" the Bus Route Roads Superintending Engineer of the GCC said. \"Further, we will also develop 200 km of footpaths at Rs 200 crore, in line with the announcement made during the Demands for Grants Assembly Session in March 2025.\"\nHe added that the GCC also plans to repair existing footpaths in the city by spending Rs 2367.14 lakh in two phases.\nBut that alone will not do.\n\"Apart from infrastructural development, enforcement in all forms, especially speed limits, is the immediate solution to reduce fatalities. This again needs to be paired with better public awareness, so that lives are not at stake on the road,\" CAG's Sowmya underlined.\nTill then, Jaysingh and others will have to keep their eyes and ears wide open while staying surefooted all the time."

            "Hogg declines to run again for DNC vice chair after new election is called. Hogg declines to run again for DNC vice chair after new election is called\nThe 25-year-old activist said he will devote his efforts to Leaders We Deserve.\nDavid Hogg will not run again for his Democratic National Committee vice chairman position, he announced on Tuesday, amid a firestorm the 25-year-old activist sparked over his pledge to take on “ineffective” Democratic incumbents.\nDNC members removed Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta through a virtual vote on Wednesday night, stemming from a procedural complaint unrelated to Hogg’s primary activities.\nIn a statement, Hogg said “there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair — and it’s okay to have disagreements.” But, Hogg continued, “what isn’t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on.”\nHogg said he would now focus his efforts on Leaders We Deserve, the group he co-founded, which said it would take on “asleep-at-the-wheel” Democrats by pledging to spend $20 million on safe-seat Democratic primaries. Hogg’s plan, announced in April, triggered a wave of anger from elected officials and DNC members, who argued that Hogg’s role as a party leader conflicted with the decision to take on incumbents.\nDNC Chair Ken Martin, who clashed with Hogg, released a statement, “commend[ing] David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map. I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.”\nThe DNC will hold new elections for the two vice chair roles beginning Thursday — the vote for the new male vice chair will take place from June 12 to June 14 and then vote for a second vice chair of any gender from June 15 to June 17. With Hogg declining to run, Kenyatta is now running unopposed for the male vice chair role.\nThree other candidates for DNC vice chair — Shasti Conrad, Kalyn Free and Jeanna Repass — submitted candidate videos to compete for the second vacancy, according to one DNC member granted anonymity to describe private details.\nEarlier this week, Hogg’s group endorsed Virginia state Del. Irene Shin in the special election for Virginia’s 11th District to replace Democratic Rep. Gerry Connelly, who died last month.\nThe internal drama within the DNC reignited again over the weekend, when POLITICO obtained audio from a DNC meeting in which Martin told Hogg and other DNC leaders that his leadership has suffered due to the clash. The vice chair, Martin said, had “essentially destroyed any chance I have” to show national leadership. Several of the DNC leaders who participated in the call expressed support for Martin and accused Hogg or his supporters of leaking it. Hogg, for his part, denied he shared it.",
            "David Hogg will not run for DNC post again after party orders redo of vice chair elections. Progressive activist David Hogg said he won’t seek to continue as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after the DNC called for a redo of the February election that elevated him to the post.\nShortly after the DNC announced it would hold new elections Thursday for two vice chair positions held by Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as a result of a procedural challenge, Hogg announced he wouldn’t be a candidate.\nThe decision comes amid a public spat with the DNC and its chairman, Ken Martin, over Hogg’s decision to support primary challenges to Democratic incumbents, a spat that loomed over the vote even though it wasn’t directly related to the challenge that ultimately led the party to call for a new election.\nHogg made the announcement in a lengthy statement that criticized the Democratic Party for a lack of vision and a refusal to pass the torch to the next generation. But his discussion about the DNC and the vice chairmanship specifically was more muted.\n\"I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair — and it’s okay to have disagreements. What isn’t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,\" he said in the statement.\n\"Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.\"\nMartin praised Hogg's for the party in a brief statement, saying, \"I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.”\n“I commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map,\" Martin said.\nFollow live politics coverage here\nThe DNC had voted hours earlier to accept a recommendation from its Credentials Committee that the party hold two new vice chair elections because it found the DNC mistakenly created an advantage for the two male candidates, Hogg and Kenyatta, as it managed the internal elections at the end of a marathon February party meeting in Washington.\nOn Wednesday evening, the DNC announced that 75% of the votes its members cast in a virtual election were in favor of the recommendation, a vote of 294-99. It said 89% of its members participated in the virtual election.\nBecause DNC rules require equal gender representation on its executive committee, not including the party chair, the results of elections in February meant the DNC had to elect at least one man to its final two vice chair slots. But instead of holding individual votes for each position, one to be filled by a man and one by a candidate of any gender, the party decided to hold one vote to decide who took the final two slots.\nOklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in February, petitioned the DNC for a redo, claiming the decision to combine the ballots unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta over the female candidates who were eligible for the final vice chair slot.\nThough Free’s challenge was filed well before Hogg’s public spat with Martin, Hogg framed the decision last month as proof that the party was trying to strip him of his title over his support for primary challenges to Democratic incumbents. Martin and Kenyatta vehemently disagreed with his framing: Martin blamed a “procedural error” from “before I became chair” for the episode, and Kenyatta criticized Hogg for distracting from the party’s work by arguing the vote amounted to personal retribution.\nAfter the new election was called, Kenyatta said in a statement that “now we can almost bring this chapter to a close,” adding that he looked forward to “making my case to DNC members and our party as a whole” in the snap election.\n“We need a strong Democratic Party and I hope we come out of this stronger and focused on the work ahead,” he said.\nWith Hogg's decision to step aside, Kenyatta is assured of winning his vice chair position back by the end of the week. The party will effectively be replacing Hogg with the winner of a subsequent vice chair election among the three candidates who were on the final ballot in February.\nTensions between Hogg and the party have been brewing for months, since he telegraphed his decision to back Democratic primary challenges through a political group he started, Leaders We Deserve. Hogg, who rose to prominence as a political activist after he was one of the victims of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, argued in his statement Wednesday night that his mission to push the Democratic Party toward \"a new vision for the future and leaders to bring us there\" was most important to him, as he accused Democrats of thinking too small.\n\"After seeing a serious lack of vision from Democratic leaders, too many of them asleep at the wheel, and Democrats dying in office that have helped to hand Republicans an expanded majority, it became clear that Leaders We Deserve had to start primarying incumbents and directly challenging the culture of seniority politics that brought our party to this place to help get our party into fighting shape again,\" he said.\nAhead of the vote, Politico published a short clip of an internal Democratic Party call on which Martin vented his frustration with Hogg, saying the fight has “essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to.”\nThe leak prompted another round of finger-pointing, with prominent DNC members accusing Hogg or his allies of orchestrating it. Hogg vehemently denied that and published a screenshot that he said showed his text messages with the reporter who published the story.\nEven if Hogg had decided to run again and won his seat back, Martin has said he would propose a neutrality pledge for officers that could have forced Hogg to choose between his party role and his role with the outside group he founded.",
            "Hogg forgoes reelection for DNC vice chair. Democratic National Committee (DNC) Vice Chair David Hogg announced Wednesday that he would be forgoing reelection for his spot in the committee after DNC members voted to redo the vice chair election of Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep.

Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit.\nKeep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR. Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.\nGenerally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers – within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a credit card that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.\nThe interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.\nCredit scores ranges may vary. Your individual chance at approval may vary due to factors such as creditors using a particular variation at their discretion.\nCompareCards' Parent Company\nAt CompareCards.com, our mission is to help people make more informed financial decisions each and every day.

            "Trump curbs immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants. Trump curbs immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants\nThe Trump administration has directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement, an official said Saturday.\nThe move follows weeks of increased enforcement since Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump's immigration policies, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump's second term.\nTatum King, an official with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, wrote regional leaders on Thursday to halt investigations of the agricultural industry, including meatpackers, restaurants and hotels, according to The New York Times.\nA U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to The Associated Press the contents of the directive. The Homeland Security Department did not dispute it.\n“We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said when asked to confirm the directive.\nThe shift suggests Trump's promise of mass deportations has limits if it threatens industries that rely on workers in the country illegally. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he disapproved of how farmers and hotels were being affected.\n“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” he wrote. “In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!”\nWhile ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.\nFarm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country’s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.\nICE made more than 70 arrests Tuesday at a food packaging company in Omaha, Nebraska. The owner of Glenn Valley Foods said the company was enrolled in a voluntary program to verify workers' immigration status and that it was operating at 30% capacity as it scrambled to find replacements.\nTom Homan, the White House border czar, has repeatedly said ICE will send officers into communities and workplaces, particularly in “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit the agency's access to local jails.\nSanctuary cities “will get exactly what they don’t want, more officers in the communities and more officers at the work sites,” Homan said Monday on Fox News Channel. “We can’t arrest them in the jail, we’ll arrest them in the community. If we can’t arrest them in community, we’re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We’re going to flood the zone.”\n___",
            "Trump, in reversal, may exempt farms and hotels from immigration raids. President Donald Trump said on social media Thursday that he is willing to exempt the agriculture and hotel industries from his nationwide immigration crackdown. The surprise move came after executives in both industries complained to Trump about losing reliable, longtime immigrant workers in immigration raids and struggling to replace them.\n“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump wrote.\n“In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs,\" he added. \"This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!”\nThe New York Times reported the next day that a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official had ordered a pause in immigration raids at agricultural businesses, meat packing plants, restaurants and hotels.\nThe senior ICE official also advised agents to stop arresting undocumented people who are not known to have committed crimes. Agents were told to continue to investigate and detain undocumented people with criminal backgrounds, according to the Times.\nIn response to a question from NBC News about Trump's pause, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin did not dispute it. “We will follow the president’s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America’s streets,\" she said in a statement.\nAn immigration crossroads\nTrump faces a political crossroads. Immigration raids in Los Angeles sparked days of violent protests there and helped fuel sweeping anti-Trump protests nationwide Saturday.\nAt the same time, Trump repeatedly promised his supporters during the 2024 campaign that he would deport a million people a year, the largest mass deportations in U.S. history.\nTo meet that goal, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller demanded last month that ICE arrest at least 3,000 undocumented people a day.\nThree former DHS officials told NBC News that ICE officials will have to significantly increase raids of large workplaces nationwide to meet those goals. The sites include farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants — the industries Trump appears to have exempted.\nA former ICE official said that only raids on “construction, dairy [and] meat processing facilities, carpet mills” would result in the large number of detentions Miller has demanded. “It’s these low-wage jobs, that is where you get the numbers,” the former official said.\nDuring the 2024 campaign and since he returned to office, Trump has dismissed warnings from experts that such large-scale deportations would lead to worker shortages in the industries he is apparently exempting now.\nBut groups that support his crackdown expect him to keep his promise.\n“They should be going after them,” said Ira Mehlman, a spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that supports a crackdown on undocumented workers. “I don’t think there is going to be a huge swath of the country that will be upset if they bust these companies, if they are employing illegal immigrants and passing on the cost to everyone else.”\nTargeting slaughterhouses\nFor years, slaughterhouses have been one of the industries best known for relying on newly arrived immigrant labor, in part because of the difficult and dangerous nature of the work. And many slaughterhouses are in red states scattered throughout the Midwest and the Southeast. Texas alone has almost 500 meat and food processing plants, according to Agriculture Department data.\nICE agents last week raided a locally owned slaughterhouse in Omaha, Nebraska, and arrested at least 80 undocumented workers, according to local officials. Chad Hartmann, a spokesperson for Glenn Valley Foods, said in a statement that federal agents searched the company’s facility “for persons believed to be using fraudulent documents to gain employment.” He said that the company strives to operate within the law, that it is cooperating with agents and that it “is not being charged with any crime.”\nBut so far ICE has not consistently targeted large slaughterhouses around the country.\nSince Trump took office in January, ICE’s workplace enforcement raids appear to have largely targeted smaller businesses, such as a roofer in Bellingham, Washington; a Mexican restaurant in Harlingen, Texas; and a small equipment manufacturer in South Dakota. One of the largest workplace raids to date — which yielded more than 100 arrests — was at a construction site in Tallahassee overseen by a privately owned Florida-based construction company.\nLarry Stine, an employment attorney who represents some of the largest meatpacking plants in the Southeast, says his clients are “terrified” of a possible raid and have been actively auditing their employees’ paperwork.\nFew construction industry raids\nTrump did not mention an exemption for the construction industry, which also employs large numbers of immigrant workers. So far, though, the construction industry has experienced relatively few ICE raids, industry officials said.\nBrian Turmail, vice president of public affairs for the Associated General Contractors of America, said that to date, he is aware of only sporadic reports of construction site raids, such as one in Tallahassee on May 29 when more than 100 allegedly undocumented people were detained.\nThe contractors’ association continues to prepare members for how to respond if the pace of enforcement actions increases. “We’ve been reposting compliance information now that it’s a bit more real,” Turmail said.\nTurmail said he remains confident that Trump is sensitive to the needs of the construction industry, whose decadeslong workforce shortage has only grown more acute in recent years. It’s one reason construction costs have been surging, he said, which, in turn, has resulted in construction spending’s declining year on year for the first time since 2019.\n“Between higher labor and higher material costs, it’s putting developers on the sidelines because projects don’t pencil out anymore,” Turmail said.\nMembers of the contractors' association remain hopeful that the administration’s promises to reorient more of the workforce toward vocational skills will turn into federal spending to do so.\nTurmail predicted that worker shortages will persist and most likely worsen if the immigration crackdown continues. One way the administration could help address them, he said, would be to create ways for construction workers to enter the country legally.\n“Even if we got all the funding we wanted, we’d still need to also find some temporary lawful pathways for people to come in and work in construction,” he said.\nDemocrats say Trump’s campaign promises of millions of mass deportations are hitting economic realities. John Sandweg, who was ICE director during the Obama administration, said that to maintain its 3,000 arrests per day quota, the Trump administration would have to raid factories owned by large corporations. “No doubt some Fortune 500 will get hit,” he said.",
            "An Omaha food plant owner says he followed the rules for hiring immigrants. An Omaha food plant owner says he followed the rules for hiring immigrants\nThe owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials\nOMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.\nThe raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.\nGlenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.\nAsked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, “I was very upset, ma’am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.”\n“We did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.\nE-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.\nSome of America’s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.\nRohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as “broken” and “flawed” to Glenn Valley executives.\nBut that does nothing to repair the company’s bottom line, Rohwer said.\n“I’d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,” he said.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.\nThe Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.\nThe raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.\nThe Metropolitan Community College’s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.\n“Everybody’s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,” Garcia said. “So there’s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.”\nThat fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.\n“You know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,” he said.\nAn aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.\nThe raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.\nDuring a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, “My message to the public is that we are with them.”\nOmaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.\n“That is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,” the chief said. “I need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they’re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.”",
            "Trump’s ICE Agents Are Arresting US Citizens. GOP Budget Would Hire 10,000 More.. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nPolls show the so-called “big, beautiful” budget bill championed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress is becoming deeply unpopular as more people learn about the deadly consequences of proposals to slash the health care safety net. However, the legislation’s massive investment in Trump’s mass deportation campaign has received far less attention from Democrats and critics, including billions of dollars to deploy 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents nationwide.\nThe GOP budget bill’s $75 billion in supplemental funding for ICE is now under increasing scrutiny as reports and viral images emerge of protests against indiscriminate immigration raids and the violent arrests of U.S. citizens by masked and heavily armed federal officers. Trump has made it clear that he is intentionally using ICE to terrorize blue cities with Democratic mayors and large immigrant communities.\nVideos of masked ICE agents arresting protesters outside an immigration court went viral earlier this week. In suburban Long Island, New York, an ICE agent got into a car crash last week after residents confronted a dozen or so masked and armed agents outside an elementary school, The Intercept reported. In Vermont, residents are demanding the release of a migrant justice organizer and his teenage daughter after ICE agents smashed their car window in order to make arrests.\nGet our free emails\nAdrian Martinez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen working at a Walmart outside of Los Angeles, was tackled and arrested by multiple U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents conducting sweeps in the area. Video shows Martinez push a trash bin in front of a border patrol truck before more vehicles pull up and armed agents surround him. Prosecutors claim Martinez punched an officer in the face, but security camera footage does not show Martinez throwing a punch before he is tackled. Martinez remained in jail facing serious federal charges as of June 20.\n“Now, they want to press charges on him and everything, but the way they were treating him and manhandling him? How are they going to press charges when they were the ones doing that to him?” said Myra Villareal, Martinez’s mother, in an interview with NBC Los Angeles.\nAfter millions of people marched against Trump ahead of the extravagant military parade he planned for his birthday on June 14, the president ordered federal law enforcement to double down on deportation operations in blue cities such as Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, suggesting he sees mass deportation as a tool for targeting political opponents with federal police. The post followed Trump’s divisive decision to deploy military troops to Los Angeles in response to isolated anti-ICE protests, generating images of a jackbooted crackdown that were quickly turned into propaganda for the pro-Trump media.\nIndeed, at least five elected officials — mostly Democrats — have been roughed up and arrested while attempting to defend their constituents or hold the Trump administration accountable. Earlier this week, New York comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by multiple masked ICE agents when escorting a man at an immigration court. As Trump ordered a peacetime deployment of the military to Los Angeles ahead of his audacious birthday last week, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) was tackled and handcuffed when attempting to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference in a local federal building.\nA Wisconsin judge as well as a New Jersey mayor and congresswoman have also been arrested and are fighting charges that Democrats say are bogus, authoritarian attempts to quash dissent. Even as critics slam the administration for ignoring due process, separating parents from schoolchildren, and invading communities with squads of federal officers, Trump’s officials consistently responded by threatening that anyone who interferes with ICE will be arrested on federal charges.\nThe tough talk from Trump’s underlings fails to mention that ICE is facing a cash crisis as it attempts to enforce policies that appear to change on the president’s whims. The agency is already $1 billion over budget and will likely violate federal law if spending continues apace, according to Axios. The cash crunch is fueled by hardliners such as Stephen Miller, Trump’s anti-immigrant adviser, who have demanded that ICE arrest 3,000 people per day to achieve deportation goals. The quota is a major reason why ICE is sparking outrage and terror through its apprehension of law-abiding immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years when they show up for immigration court dates and check-ins.\nThat’s where the GOP budget bill comes in. The legislation includes $75 billion in supplemental funding for expanding ICE enforcement operations inside the U.S. over the next four years, including $10 billion for hiring thousands of agents and other personnel. In comparison, ICE’s entire 2024 budget did not exceed $9 billion. The bill would also quadruple the budget for border patrol. Both agencies fall under the Department of Homeland Security, which was created by President George W. Bush during the “war on terror” following the 9/11 attacks.\nThe GOP budget bill’s proposal for slashing Medicaid health coverage for lower-income and disabled people is becoming increasingly unpopular, and Trump’s immigration crackdown is rapidly losing public support as well. Both Trump’s approval on the issue and support for ICE is slipping.\nPolling shows that a plurality of voters opposes the House version of the budget bill that passed last month, and support slips further when respondents learn about specific provisions in the legislation. MSNBC reported that the bill could impact Trump’s already low approval ratings, and so far, the media and most Democrats have focused on proposals to slash safety programs that provide health care and food assistance. If the bill’s massive funding increase for immigration policing agencies hits the headlines while they are actively clashing with U.S. communities, Republicans may soon be facing an uphill battle for public opinion with midterms looming.\nKeep the press free.

            "Four Ways ICE Is Training New Agents And Scaling Up. BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump’s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.\nSome might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.\nOverall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.\nAfter years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.\nLast week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency’s top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.\nICE is surging its hiring\nICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year’s end.\nThe agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.\nNew recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That’s a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.\nCaleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he’s been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they’re assigned.\nICE is also preparing for conflict\nAs Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.\nVitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency’s data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.\nLyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. “Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,” he said.\nLyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.”\nAnd it’s beefing up specialized units for risky situations\nAbout eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.\nThey are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.\n“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,” Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”\nThere are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.\nHe said he’d like to have more such units but wouldn’t put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they’re also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.\nICE teaches whom agents can arrest — and when\nNew recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.\nIn limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone’s home. Generally when they’re seeking someone they’re trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn’t allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.\nVitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they’re taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.\n“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.\nMultiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.\nAs ICE sees it, Vitello said, deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency’s lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.\nAdvocates for immigrants and the government have often disagreed about how much authority ICE has to make those arrests and where.",
            "Immigration Detention Has Become a Booming Business for Private Prison Giants. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!\nAmid escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric and legislative crackdowns at the state and federal levels, private prison corporations are once again expanding their grip on U.S. detention policy. In fact, today roughly 90 percent of detained immigrants are held in privately operated facilities, the highest share in history.\nThis industry exists despite years of promises to phase out for-profit incarceration that started in 2016 with President Barack Obama and were renewed by President Joe Biden when he took office. Unfortunately, these promises focused exclusively on the Bureau of Prisons and excluded immigration detention. As such, through their presidencies most federal contracts with private prison corporations remained untouched in the immigration detention space.\nNow, with another Trump presidency, the industry is instead preparing for explosive growth. On recent earnings calls, CoreCivic executives announced plans to triple the number of beds in their facilities within a few months. That would mean an additional $1.5 billion in revenue for the corporation, more than doubling its annual earnings.\nStay in the loop\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nMeanwhile, growing scrutiny of immigration detention practices has led to reports of abuse, medical neglect, and deaths in custody. Privatization, with the cost-cutting practices that define it, is the structural driver of human rights violations at these facilities.\nWe discuss this all at length in our recently released book, The Prison Industry: How it Works and Who Profits (The New Press, 2025). But as we also explain, private prisons corporations are just one piece of the sprawling prison industry. The U.S. carceral system is comprised of a vast and deeply entrenched network of public-private partnerships that make billions from incarceration and detention every year.\nCommissary corporations mark-up basic hygiene items like toothpaste or tampons by 300 percent or more. Private healthcare providers routinely deny or delay treatment, contributing to suffering and preventable deaths behind bars. Private food vendors serve meals that are frequently expired or nutritionally inadequate, all in the name of cutting costs and maximizing returns.\nTo understand how we arrived at this moment, we must pause and get familiar with the larger machinery that gave rise to it. The private prison industry did not emerge in isolation; it is the product of decades of deliberate policy choices that fused mass incarceration and detention with private profiteering.\nBelow, we share with Truthout’s readers an excerpt from the book’s chapter on the operations and management of private prisons.\nThe Emergence and Growth of Private Prisons in the U.S.\nThe first private prison corporation, CoreCivic (then known as Corrections Corporation of America), was founded in 1983. The founding executives included a former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party and a former warden of the Ramsey Prison Farm in Texas who had used incarcerated Black men as personal servants on his plantation. The new corporation hastily signed its first contract to build and operate a federal immigration detention center in Texas, but things did not start smoothly. When construction took longer than expected, executives rented a motel, put up barbed wire, and opened the nation’s first private immigration detention center. CoreCivic’s largest competitor, the GEO Group (GEO), then known as Wackenhut, got its start the following year with a federal contract for an immigration detention center in Colorado.\nThrough the 1990s and 2000s, the industry built up its business by pushing draconian criminal laws that drove incarceration across the country. Until 2010, CoreCivic played a prominent role in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative trade organization through which lawmakers and corporate executives work together to draft model legislation. As an active member, and at times even corporate chair of ALEC’s Criminal Justice Task Force in the early 1990s, CoreCivic executives helped draft and champion model legislation for mandatory minimum, “three strikes,” and “truth-in-sentencing” laws.\nThe notorious 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill codified these and other severe sentencing laws at the federal level, and included billions of dollars in prison construction grants for states that passed similar legislation. Within a year, 25 states passed “truth-in-sentencing” laws, which require people to serve a substantial portion of their sentence before they can be eligible for parole.\nIn 1995, ALEC members drafted the Private Correctional Facilities Act to expand the use of private prisons state by state and the Prison Industries Act to expand the private sector’s access to prison labor. And the following year, thanks to a proposed amendment and testimony by executives at GEO, the Appropriations Act of 1996 amended the original crime bill, which was silent on private prisons, to authorize states to use federal grants issued under the bill to privatize prisons.\nThe industry thrived again until 2016, when the Obama administration announced it would phase out private prison contracts with the Bureau of Prisons after a study revealed that privately run facilities were less safe than publicly run facilities. The Department of Homeland Security followed by announcing a review of immigration detention centers [immigration jails], but eventually decided it would continue its use of private prisons, citing a lack of alternative options. Still, overnight, the stock price of the largest two private prison operators, Core- Civic and GEO, tanked 40 percent and 35 percent, respectively.\nPanicked executives moved to pay their way to survival. Within days, GEO contributed $250,000 to pro-Trump super political action committees. After Trump’s election, CoreCivic and GEO curried favor with the incoming administration by donating an additional $250,000 each to the Trump inauguration fund. As a further sign of support, GEO also moved its annual meeting to a Trump resort.\nThis patronage paid off: the Trump administration rescinded the phase-out policy just weeks after taking office, going as far as to instruct Bureau of Prisons officials to identify incarcerated people for transfer to private facilities.\nGEO’s donations forced campaign finance watchdogs to sue the Federal Election Committee for allowing the corporation to circumvent the ban on contributions from federal contractors, a claim still being investigated by regulators. But the administration continued its support of the industry with passage of the First Step Act, which while responsible for the release of tens of thousands of people from federal prisons funneled millions into new reentry services provided by private prison operators, among other things.\nThen, in January 2021, the new Biden administration issued an executive order reverting back to the Obama-era directive barring new contracts with private prison corporations for the operation of federal prisons. The executive order similarly excluded immigration detention centers. Since then, the number of detained immigrants housed in private facilities has continued to increase.\nDespite policy volatility, the industry remains stubbornly entrenched in the federal system today with more than half of its revenues each year coming from federal contracts. But in recent decades, CoreCivic and GEO spent billions diversifying their business lines to ensure their survival.\nPrivate Prison Corporations Maximize Profits at the Expense of Incarcerated People\nCompensated for each day a person spends in one of their beds, private prison corporations drive profitability in just two ways: by increasing the number of people in their facilities or cutting costs related to their care. Since their start, these corporations have done both with dire consequences.\nFor decades now, private prison corporations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying to advance policies that put more people in prison for longer and promote the unregulated use of private prisons. It is a story that has been written about often.\nLess known is the way in which they expand their market share by maintaining a revolving door of informal influence with departments of corrections, regularly hiring former correctional administrators into high-paying roles — often just days after leaving their government posts. These new corporate executives use their government experience and relationships to usher in and negotiate lucrative contracts for their new employers.\nBut these corporations also have even more direct ways to increase prison stays in their facilities or further extract value from incarcerated people, and they exercise them liberally. Disciplinary infractions are just one example. Corrections officers in private prisons, like those in public prisons, can issue disciplinary infractions, hold review hearings, determine guilt or innocence, and hand down punitive sentences. In private prisons, these sentences often involve the loss of good-time credit, lengthening a person’s stay and padding their bottom lines. Unsurprisingly, the rate of guilty findings in disciplinary review hearings is quite high — easily over 95 percent in many private prisons. In one such disciplinary hearing in a CoreCivic facility, a man lost 30 days of good-time credit because he used a broom to sweep the area in front of his cell without permission, which generated an extra $2,000 for the corporation.\nYet, the easiest way that private prison corporations stretch their profit is by lowering operational costs, particularly staff pay, their largest expense. Offering below-market wages and limited benefits, they attract underqualified staff. Making matters worse, they spend, on aver-age, 58 fewer hours training staff than publicly run facilities, and what little training they offer emphasizes use of force — rather than de-escalation — as a response to every situation, including mental health crises. The outcomes are frustrating for officers set up to fail and detrimental for incarcerated people at their whim. At one CoreCivic facility in Tennessee, for instance, poorly trained officers pepper-sprayed a man who had attempted suicide before trying to help him.\nEfforts to minimize costs and pad profits also leave facilities to deteriorate. Private prison corporations have little interest in maintaining existing facilities and often let them fall into disrepair. In 2018, MTC was sued by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ACLU for the deplorable conditions in its Mississippi prisons that included incidents of cells with no lights and rats crawling out of toilets.\nPrivatization Drives Longer Stays and Human Rights Violations in Immigration Jails\nThe private prison model does not differ much from the corrections system to the immigration detention system. Business is still driven by more bodies, longer stays, and low costs. So, much like it does in the corrections system, the private prison industry pushes for harsh immigration policies intended to drive up immigration detention. And private immigration detention centers suffer from many of the same problems as private prisons and jails, but the people held in them have even fewer rights and thus, at times, can suffer even more abuse.\nAs they do in their prisons and jails, private prison corporations cut corners on staffing and training in immigration detention centers. In fact, given the lower-risk population, they can drive costs down even more significantly and produce even greater human rights violations. For instance, in 2017, Omar Rivera, an asylum-seeker from El Salvador, led a hunger strike to protest poor conditions at the Adelanto Detention Center run by GEO. In response, staff beat him, pepper-sprayed him, and placed him in solitary confinement for nearly two weeks, according to a lawsuit filed by Rivera and seven others who were detained at the facility. The lawsuit, which was settled for an undisclosed amount, is one of several against GEO involving assaults and deaths at the Adelanto facility.\nImportantly, the privatization of the Adelanto facility is itself an impropriety, but a common one in the space. Looking to circumvent rigorous federal procurement procedures, ICE and its private prison contractors often look to intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) to indirectly contract through counties. In these agreements, ICE contracts with counties for beds for detained immigrants, and the county in turn subcontracts the operation of its facility to a private prison corporation. The county and private prison corporation then split the per diem ICE pays for each person held in the facility. Interested in seeing more money flow into their districts, county officials have joined the corporations in pushing for harsher immigration laws. IGSAs represent a win, win, win for ICE, counties, and private prison corporations all at the expense of the people detained.\nPrivate prisons are a uniquely U.S. export, which emerged in the 1980s as the perfect encapsulation of the decade’s embrace of Reagan-era privatization and greed. Prisons had always been used to generate revenue, but this was something new: the complete outsourcing of the criminal legal system to the highest bidder. And the corruption of money in politics allowed them to help decimate families in disproportionately Black, brown, and Indigenous communities.\nSince then, private prisons have embedded themselves in every facet of the criminal and immigration systems. While people have begun to challenge private prison corporations, there must be vigilant attention paid to the industry’s attempt to change its toxic image and expand into adjacent business lines. After all, whether walls are built out of concrete, wire, or WiFi, a prison is still a prison, and a private prison still needs more bodies to grow. No matter their form, private prison corporations have no place in any system that claims to be about justice.\nPress freedom is under attack\nAs Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.\nTruthout produces reporting you won’t see in the mainstream: journalism from on the ground in Gaza, interviews with grassroots movement leaders, high-quality legal analysis, and more.\nOur work is possible thanks to reader support.

            "Trump seethes that Dems floating bill requiring the unmasking of ICE, CBP agents must 'hate' America. President Donald Trump slammed a pair of Democratic lawmakers for introducing a bill that would require federal immigration law enforcement officers to not wear face masks and have legible IDs while on the job, saying the lawmakers must \"hate our country\" or they \"wouldn't be saying that.\"\n\"Two Democratic senators now, Cory Booker and Alex Padilla, have a new bill out.

I'm surprised that they would do it knowing a little bit about them.\"\n\"These officers are doing a tremendous job,\" he continued. \"They're great patriots. If you expose them because of, you know, statements like have been made by Democrat and others on the left, usually mostly, I think, probably exclusively, you put them in great danger, tremendous danger.\"\nBLUE STATE LAWMAKER RALLIES AROUND MASK BAN FOR FEDERAL AGENTS AS ICE OPERATIONS RAMP UP\nDemocratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California introduced a bill Tuesday, dubbed the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act, that would require CBP and ICE agents to wear an identification badge while working and that they not wear face masks that conceal their identity.\nDHS FIRES BACK AT DEMOCRATS FOR 'BEYOND THE PALE' RHETORIC AS ICE AGENTS FACE WAVE OF VIOLENT THREATS\n\"For weeks, Americans have watched federal agents with no visible identification detain people off the streets and instill fear in communities across the country,\" Booker said of the bill Tuesday. \"Reports of individuals impersonating ICE officers have only increased the risk to public and officer safety. The lack of visible identification and uniform standards for immigration enforcement officers has created confusion, stoked fear, and undermined public trust in law enforcement.\"\nFederal immigration law enforcement officers have been targeted repeatedly in recent days, including at least two ambushes in Texas, and protesters clashing with federal officers at the Portland, Oregon, ICE facility after Trump signed the \"big beautiful bill\" into law Friday.\nAnti-ICE rhetoric especially intensified in June, when federal officials descended on Los Angeles to conduct raids to deport illegal immigrants, which was met by protests that devolved into riots last month as local Democratic leaders condemned the Trump administration for its immigration policies.\n\"And it's sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard and they have masks on more than masks, I mean, you can't see anything. Nobody complains about that. But when a patriot who works for ICE or Border Patrol puts a mask on so that they won't recognize him and his family, so they can lead a little bit of a normal life after having worked so hard and so dangerously,\" Trump continued in his response to Doocy about why federal agents should not conduct their work unmasked. \"There's a problem with that.\"\nFEDERAL OFFICIALS SLAM DEMOCRATS FOR 'DANGEROUS' RHETORIC AS ICE AGENTS FACE VIOLENT MOBS IN LA, NYC\nTrump continued that Democrats have become \"somewhat deranged\" and added that wealthy people on the left are likely funding rioters to attack federal law enforcement officers.\n\"This is the problem with the Democrats,\" Trump said. \"They have a lot of bad things going on in their heads. They've become very… they've lost their confidence, number one. And they're really, they've become somewhat deranged. I want to do whatever necessary to protect our great law enforcement people. And they are right at the top of the list.\"\nDoocy asked Trump about the ambush in Alvarado, Texas, on the Fourth of July that led to the arrest of 10 rioters.\n\"President Trump in Alvarado, Texas, a few days ago, 10 people wearing all black allegedly set off fireworks outside an ICE office to lure the officers out so they could ambush them, shoot at them. They had guns and vests and two-way radios. Do you think that this was an isolated incident, or do you think there's a national threat of a left-wing militia that is targeting ICE and CBP?\" Doocy asked.\nTrump shot back that \"some very stupid people on the left\" are funding rioters who are targeting the officers.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I think you have some very stupid people on the left who have some money that are making it available to these people,\" Trump said. \"Because you look at the guns they had, they were brand new. You look at even the clothing they were wearing, it looked like it just came out of some military shop. So you have some very stupid people that, if anything ever happened, they'd be the first to go.\"\n\"They'd be the first ones hit,\" Trump added."

Senate votes to end debate on stablecoin bill, teeing up final vote\nThe Senate voted Thursday to wrap up debate on a stablecoin bill, teeing up a final vote on the legislation that would establish regulatory rules of the road for the dollar-backed cryptocurrencies.\nKeeping in line with earlier votes on the GENIUS Act, a small contingent of Democrats voted with most Republicans to tee up a final vote on the crypto bill, which will likely occur early next week.\nThe legislation had to clear a few smaller votes Thursday before senators could cast their ballots to end debate.\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who has repeatedly voiced concerns about President Trump’s growing ties to the crypto industry, sought to force a vote on an amendment that would “end current and potential criminal corruption by federal elected officials.”\nDemocrats have increasingly expressed alarm, as crypto legislation has progressed at the same time the president and his family launch various crypto ventures.\nTrump launched a meme coin shortly before his inauguration, the top investors in which were invited to a private dinner with the president last month.\nWorld Liberty Financial, the crypto firm launched by Trump and his sons last fall, also unveiled a stablecoin in March that was later used to complete a controversial $2 billion transaction between an Emirati firm and the crypto exchange Binance.\n“This is the U.S. government for sale in a way we’ve never seen,” Merkley said Thursday from the Senate floor. “This is the Mount Everest of corruption. And right at this moment, the Senate is debating a cryptocurrency bill.”\n“Isn’t this the moment we should debate whether or not federal elected officials — ourselves, the vice president, the president, members of the Cabinet — should be offering for sale our personal coins in order for people to give us money,” he continued. “Because really, it’s just like somebody handing us a stack of money.”\nThe effort was voted down almost entirely along party lines, with all Democrats supporting the measure. Nearly every Republican opposed, with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has repeatedly voted against the GENIUS Act.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) initially vowed to hold an open amendment process on the bill. However, as controversial amendments threatened the GENIUS Act’s future, he scrapped the push for so-called regular order.\nHe instead scheduled a vote Wednesday on an updated version of the bill, reached as part of negotiations between Republicans and crypto-friendly Democrats last month.\nThe GENIUS Act picked up two new votes from Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) on Wednesday but lost Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester’s (D-Del.) support following the decision to forgo the open amendment process.\nBlunt Rochester, who voted for the bill both in the Senate Banking Committee in March and on the Senate floor last month, had emphasized that she hoped to see additional changes down the line.\nAs the stablecoin bill heads to a final vote, another key crypto bill is gaining steam on the House side. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would divvy up oversight of the broader crypto market between two financial regulators, advanced out of two House committees Tuesday.\nThe Trump administration and GOP leaders have repeatedly underscored their hopes of getting both stablecoin and crypto market structure bills across the finish line before lawmakers head out of town for their August recess.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

            "Stablecoin bill clears another hurdle in Senate, inching toward final vote. Stablecoin bill clears another hurdle in Senate, inching toward final vote\nThe Senate voted Wednesday to advance legislation setting up a regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, bringing the crypto bill one step closer to a final vote in the upper chamber.\nEighteen Democrats voted with almost every Republican to end debate on an updated version of the GENIUS Act.\nThe new bill text was reached as part of lengthy negotiations between Republicans and crypto-friendly Democrats last month, ahead of an earlier procedural vote on the Senate floor last month.\nThe vote breakdown was largely similar to the May vote, although the bill picked up support from Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) while Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) switched her vote to oppose the measure.\nBlunt Rochester had supported the bill both in the Senate Banking Committee in March and on the Senate floor last month.\nShe voiced some hesitation Tuesday about Senate leadership’s decision to forgo an open amendment process on the GENIUS Act, emphasizing that she hoped to see additional changes to the bill.\n“I was really clear,” she told The Hill. “I hoped that there would be an open amendment process, and that’s what I heard Leader Thune say around last month, so I will take a look at this language, and we’ll make a decision from there.”\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) ultimately scrapped the push for so-called “regular order,” as controversial amendments — most notably, Sen. Roger Marshall’s (R-Kan.) Credit Card Competition Act — threatened to upend support for the bill.\nThe decision to move forward without an open amendments process frustrates a push by several Democrats to add in a provision that would prevent President Trump and other elected officials from profiting off stablecoins.\n“The GENIUS act attempts to set up some guardrails for buying and selling a type of cryptocurrency, one type called a stablecoin,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said on the Senate floor ahead of Wednesday’s vote.\n“Well, we need guardrails that ensure that government officials aren’t openly asking people to buy their coins in order to increase their personal profit or their family’s profit,” he continued. “Where are those guardrails in this bill? They’re completely, totally absent.”\nHowever, crypto-friendly Democrats who have been deeply involved in negotiations are urging their colleagues to support the bill despite some of its shortcomings.\n“It’s extremely unhelpful that we have a president who’s involved in this industry, and I would love to ban this activity, but that does not diminish the excellent work of this legislation,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday.\n“It does not diminish the hard work that bipartisan group of senators put into this to make a difference and to write a law that can protect consumers, that can protect our financial services industry, that can protect the strength of the dollar, and that can protect people who would like access to capital,” she added.\nThe GENIUS Act likely faces a handful more votes before it can clear the Senate and head to the House. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) told The Hill on Tuesday that she expects a final vote on the bill next week.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

            "US Senate Democrats cross the aisle to help Republicans pass crypto bill. The Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what the industry hopes will be a wave of bills to bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.\nThe fast-moving legislation, which passed by a 68-30 vote and will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle in which the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.\nThe bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest – an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.\nEighteen Democratic senators crossed the aisle to vote for the legislation on Tuesday, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate. The Republican senators Josh Hawley and Rand Paul were the only members of their party to oppose the measure.\nKnown as the Genius Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the US dollar. The acronym stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins”\nThe bill only needed a simple majority vote to pass on Tuesday, after it had already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote, with 18 Democrats siding with Republicans. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.\nIt was the second major bipartisan bill to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act on immigration enforcement in January. Still, most Democrats opposed the bill. They raised concerns that the measure does little to address Donald Trump’s personal financial interests in the crypto space.\n“We weren’t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,” said Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, on Monday. Alsobrooks, a co-sponsor of the bill, added, “This is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.”\nThe stablecoin legislation still faces several hurdles before reaching the president’s desk. It must clear the narrow Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill – sweeping legislation that could make a second passage through the Senate more difficult. Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.\nBill Hagerty, the bill’s sponsor and a Republican senator from Tennessee, said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote: “With this bill, the United States is a step closer to being a global leader in crypto.”\nA provision in the bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. That prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.\n“Passing the Genius Act without strong anti-corruption measures stamps a congressional seal of approval on President Trump selling access to the government for personal profit,” said Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator from Oregon, in a statement after the bill’s passage.\nElizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate banking committee, warning that the bill creates a “super highway” for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.\nLast month, the Republican president hosted a private dinner at his golf club in Virginia with top investors in a Trump-branded memecoin. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin, USD1.\nTrump reported earning $57.35m from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released Friday. A memecoin linked to him has generated an estimated $320m in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors.\nAmong the Democrats who backed the bill was Elissa Slotkin, a first-term senator who received $10m in support from a crypto political action committee during her Michigan race last year. Slotkin acknowledged the bill “wasn’t perfect” but called it a “good-faith, bipartisan start” to regulating stablecoins.\nThe administration is broadly supportive of crypto’s growth and its integration into the economy. Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, urged the Senate to pass the bill, saying it could help stablecoins “grow into a $3.7tn market by the end of the decade”."

            "16 things to watch to educate yourself about systemic racism. - Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.\n- These 16 movies and shows are a good place to start to learn about systemic racism.\n- They include biopics like \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" and comedies like \"Sorry to Bother You.\"\nReading books and watching documentaries is a part of education, but fictional movies or dramatizations of real stories can be equally illuminating.\nThursday, June 19, is Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the US. To mark the holiday, we picked 16 movies and TV shows that will help people understand the history of racism in this country, from the Martin Luther King Jr. biopic \"Selma\" to the 1961 film \"A Raisin in the Sun\" to the horror-comedy \"Get Out.\"\nKeep scrolling for our recommendations of movies and TV shows to watch to educate yourself.\n\"Nickel Boys\"\nA 2025 nominee for best picture at the Academy Awards, \"Nickel Boys\" is a film based on the Colson Whitehead novel of the same name.\nIt's told from the point of view (literally) of Elwood, a Black teenager in 1960s Florida who has been unjustly convicted of stealing a car when he had just been hitching a ride. He's then sent to Nickel Academy, a segregated reform school where the white students are treated well, while the Black students are beaten, forced to do manual labor, and given little to no education.\nEven though much has been written about \"Nickel Boys'\" innovative cinematography, the film is much more than that.\n\"'Nickel Boys' is a triumph. Its unique approach brings a new dimension to its source material, while amplifying the emotional resonance between the present and a horrifying past,\" wrote Kambole Campbell for Empire Magazine.\n\"Nickel Boys\" is streaming on MGM+.\n\"The Hate U Give\"\n\"The Hate U Give,\" which is based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Angie Thomas, follows Starr after her best friend, Khalil, is fatally shot during a traffic stop.\n\"Now, facing pressure from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what's right,\" IMDb writes.\n\"It's so gripping to watch — as well as being, in places, just delightfully funny — that you never feel you're being preached to. It picks you up in one place and sets you down in another,\" wrote Stephanie Zacharek of Time.\nThe film's director, George Tillman Jr., announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"The Hate U Give\" was free to stream in June 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes.\n\"I hope the film provides a bit of understanding. Our story is a reminder to never be afraid to raise our voice in the name of justice. We must stand up for what we believe. The time for change is now!\" Tillman wrote.\nYou can rent or buy \"The Hate U Give\" online.\n\"Just Mercy\"\nMichael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx starred in \"Just Mercy\" in 2019, which is based on the real case of Walter McMillian and his lawyer, Bryan Stevenson.\nStevenson, a well-known civil rights attorney known for founding the Equal Justice Initiative, works throughout the film to free McMillian, a man who has been wrongfully convicted of killing a white woman and put on death row.\n\"'Just Mercy' captures Bryan Stevenson's story for posterity's sake. We shall never forget,\" wrote Alan Ng of Film Threat.\nYou can rent or buy \"Just Mercy\" online.\n\"When They See Us\"\nAva DuVernay's Netflix miniseries, \"When They See Us,\" is based on the case of the Central Park Five — now called the Exonerated Five —a group of teenagers who were wrongfully convicted in the rape of a jogger.\nThe series, which is split into four parts, delves deep into the fear and racism that surrounded the case, as reported by the BBC.\nHannah Giorgis of The Atlantic wrote, \"In rendering their journeys, DuVernay pays careful attention to the terrifying power of language, especially the animalistic rhetoric with which prosecutors and journalists referred to the teens.\"\n\"When They See Us\" is streaming on Netflix.\n\"Loving\"\n\"Loving\" is about Richard and Mildred Loving, a couple whose arrest for interracial marriage in Virginia kicked off a legal fight that led to the Supreme Court's historic 1967 decision ending anti-miscegenation laws.\n\"What is radical about [Jeff] Nichols' film is the extent to which he focuses not on the legal fight and ensuing national attention but on the Lovings themselves,\" wrote Newsweek's Tom Shone.\nYou can rent or buy \"Loving\" online.\n\"Fruitvale Station\"\n\"Fruitvale Station\" is another dramatization of a real crime — the San Francisco Chronicle reported Oscar Grant died in 2009 after he was detained and shot in the back by a police officer at a San Francisco BART station. He was 22 years old.\nRyan Coogler's directorial debut, \"Fruitvale Station,\" tells the story of the last day of Grant's life before he was shot. If you were a fan of \"Sinners\" and want to dive into Coogler's filmography, \"Fruitvale Station\" is a great place to start.\nMatthew Lucas of The Dispatch wrote, \"It's a rough sit, sometimes unpleasant, and ultimately deeply painful, but somehow an essential watch.\"\n\"Fruitvale Station\" is streaming on The Roku Channel, Plex, and Prime Video.\n\"Selma\"\n\"Fueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, 'Selma' draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Martin Luther King, Jr. — but doesn't ignore how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied,\" according to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\"'Selma' is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it,\" wrote Ryan Syrek of The Reader.\nDirector Ava DuVernay announced on X that Paramount made \"Selma\" free to rent for the month of June 2020. \"We've gotta understand where we've been to strategize where we're going. History helps us create the blueprint. Onward,\" her tweet read.\n\"Selma\" is streaming on Paramount+ and MGM+.\n\"Get Out\"\nNo spoilers; the twists and turns of \"Get Out\" should be seen on screen. But the basic gist: An interracial couple, Rose and Chris, travel to Rose's parents' house so Chris can meet them, but Rose and her parents are white, and her parents don't know her boyfriend is Black. Drama and uncomfortable jokes ensue.\n\"The villains here aren't southern rednecks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called 'white supremacy.' They're middle-class white liberals. The kind of people who read this website. The kind of people who shop at Trader Joe's, donate to the ACLU, and would have voted for Obama a third time if they could,\" Lanre Bakare of The Guardian wrote.\nYou can buy or rent \"Get Out\" online.\n\"A Raisin in the Sun\"\nThe movie, based on the Lorraine Hansberry play of the same name, centers on the Youngers, a Black family living in a city. The family must decide what to do with a $10,000 life insurance check. It deals with themes of racism, feminism, and economic inequality, among others.\nA 2019 retrospective from Film Frenzy calls the film \"a groundbreaking work that manages to be both specific to the African-American experience and universal in its themes of hope, change, and upward mobility.\"\n\"A Raisin in the Sun\" is streaming on Tubi.\n\"If Beale Street Could Talk\"\nThe film centers on Tish and Fonny, who have begun dating after being friends their whole lives. When Fonny is falsely accused of rape, Tish and her family work together to support each other and try to get Fonny freed.\nMatthew Norman of the London Evening Standard wrote, \"[Director Barry] Jenkins doesn't scratch the surface of the Black American experience. He takes you deep into its bones and suggests that far less has changed than the naive may believe.\"\n\"If Beale Street Could Talk\" is streaming on The Roku Channel, Plex, and Prime Video.\n\"Do the Right Thing\"\nSpike Lee's seminal film \"Do the Right Thing\" takes place on the hottest day of the summer in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bed-Stuy. And as the heat rises, so do tensions between the Black residents of Bed-Stuy, the Italian-American owner of the local pizzeria, and the Korean immigrants who own a local convenience store.\n\"If you think Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing' is dangerous, let me ask you: Aren't the problems he addresses, and our silent neglect of them, far more dangerous?\" asked Eva Yaa Asantewaa of OutWeek.\n\"Do the Right Thing\" is streaming on Netflix.\n\"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\"BlacKkKlansman\" is based on the 2014 memoir \"Black Klansman\" by Ron Stallworth, the first Black detective in Colorado Springs, and was also directed by Spike Lee.\nThe film tells the story of Stallworth's real-life infiltration into a Colorado chapter of the Ku Klux Klan with the help of his fellow officer Flip Zimmerman. In the film, Stallworth is played by John David Washington, while Zimmerman is played by Adam Driver.\nWhile communicating over the phone with KKK leader David Duke (played by Topher Grace), Stallworth also deals with racism within his own police department and his reluctance to tell the woman he's dating that he's a cop.\nAs Slate's Lawrence Ware wrote, positing what it will feel like to watch \"BlacKkKlansman\" 20 years from now, \"We can hope it will feel dated, but as 'BlacKkKlansman' argues, and the previous three decades of Lee's movies have taught us, it's likely to feel as pertinent as ever. Time may pass, but the struggle against racism in America remains largely the same.\"\n\"BlacKkKlansman\" is streaming on Prime Video and Paramount+.\n\"Sorry to Bother You\"\nIn \"Sorry to Bother You,\" released in 2018, LaKeith Stanfield stars as Cash Green, an unemployed Black man who gets a job at a shady telemarketing company. But he can only get ahead using his \"white voice\" (voiced by David Cross).\nAs he climbs the corporate ladder, he distances himself from a union drive at his company and makes moral compromises he didn't think he had in him — and a lot more, but we don't want to spoil the truly absurd turn this movie takes.\n\"It's about exploitation and profit, about the fetishization of Black bodies and the indignities of code-switching, about giving up your dignity and trying to find love. Careening from office comedy to something like horror, 'Sorry to Bother You' is weird and funny and unsettling, and not quite like anything I've seen before,\" wrote Vox's Alissa Wilkinson.\n\"Sorry to Bother You\" is streaming on Pluto TV, Plex, and Prime Video.\n\"Hidden Figures\"\n\"Hidden Figures,\" loosely based on the book of the same name, focuses on three Black women working at NASA in the 1960s: Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Monáe), as they confronted both racism and sexism in the workplace.\nAfter years of their contributions to NASA and space travel being erased, \"Hidden Figures\" is a celebration of their hard work and perseverance, as well as a hard look at what it was like in the struggle to be taken seriously by their peers.\n\"It might be one of the few Hollywood movies about the civil rights era to imagine that Black lives in the '60s, particularly Black women's lives, were affected not only by racism but also by the space race and the Cold War,\" wrote K. Austin Collins for The Ringer.\nYou can buy or rent \"Hidden Figures\" online.\n\"Judas and the Black Messiah\"\n\"Judas and the Black Messiah,\" released in 2021, stars Daniel Kaluuya in an Oscar-winning performance as Fred Hampton, a Black Panther leader who was assassinated by police officers backed by the FBI.\nBut where did they get their information? From an informant in the Black Panthers organization, Bill O'Neal, played by LaKeith Stanfield — although, according to the film, O'Neal, who was originally recruited to clear his own criminal record, tried to quit multiple times when he became too invested in Hampton and the cause.\nThe New York Times' A.O. Scott called the film \"a political tragedy\" and discussed how the title refers to \"the paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen), who saw African-American militants as the gravest internal threat to national security and feared the emergence of a popular, crowd-inspiring national leader\" — and thus, felt the need to remove him from the playing field.\nYou can buy or rent \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" online.\n\"Dear White People\"\n\"Dear White People\" is a 2014 dark comedy about what it's like for Black students to attend a prestigious, mainly white college, and how the four students the film focuses on (Tessa Thompson's Sam, Teyonah Parris' Coco, Tyler James Williams' Lionel, and Brandon P. Bell's Troy) each experience life at Winchester College.\nBut when a frat on campus throws a blackface-themed party, the four are united in their outrage.\n\"The film explores how two members of the same race can have vastly different experiences depending on how dark their skin is, as well as why certain people can say and act one way, but not others,\" wrote IndieWire's Jenna Marotta.\n\"Dear White People,\" the 2014 film, is streaming on Prime Video. The 2017 TV series based on the film is streaming on Netflix.",
            "Corporate Sponsors Pull Support For Juneteenth Celebrations. AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Juneteenth celebrations have been scaled back this year due to funding shortfalls as companies and municipalities across the country reconsider their support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nCanceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday’s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States.\nThe shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump’s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.\nIn Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city’s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.\n“There were quite a few sponsors who pulled back their investments or let us know they couldn’t or wouldn’t be in a position to support this year,” said Harris, who has overseen the event for more than a decade.\nThe festival, which takes place in the historically Black Five Points neighborhood, has been scaled back to one day instead of two because of the budget shortfall. It has only been able to stay afloat thanks to donations from individuals and foundations.\n“Thankfully, there was a wide range of support that came when we made the announcement that the celebration is in jeopardy,” Harris said.\nJuneteenth celebrates the day the last enslaved people in Texas were told they were free on June 19, 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.

            "Karen Read acquitted of second-degree murder charge in death of police officer boyfriend. Karen Read acquitted of second-degree murder charge in death of police officer boyfriend\nA Massachusetts jury found Karen Read not guilty of the most serious charges and guilty on a lesser charge related to the 2022 death of her Boston police officer boyfriend John O’Keefe, ending a weekslong trial that has drawn intense attention from true-crime fans across the country.\nThe jury convicted Read of operating a vehicle under of the influence but not on charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. Read was sentenced to one year probation.\nProsecutors accused Read of backing into O’Keefe with her Lexus SUV in a drunken rage and leaving him to die in the snow after a night out drinking with friends in January 2022.\nHer defense team claimed she was framed for O’Keefe’s death by cops who beat O’Keefe, let a dog attack him, threw him in the snow and then purposefully botched the investigation.\nAs the verdict was announced, Read smiled and embraced her defense team. Outside, her supporters could be heard cheering and chanting \"Karen is free.\"\nO'Keefe's family called the jury's decision \"a devastating miscarriage of justice,\" in a statement released to USA TODAY.\n\"Today, our hearts are with John and the entire O’Keefe family. They have suffered through so much and deserved better from our justice system,\" Jennifer McCabe, Matthew McCabe, Chris Albert, Julie Albert, Colin Albert, Nicole Albert, Brian Albert, Kerry Roberts, and Curt Roberts said in a statement. \"While we may have more to say in the future, today we mourn with John’s family and lament the cruel reality that this prosecution was infected by lies and conspiracy theories spread by Karen Read, her defense team, and some in the media.\"\nMore: Who is Karen Read and why is she on trial again? Catch up on the murder case\nThe verdict comes nearly a year after Read’s first trial ended in a hung jury.\nInterest in the case has swept the country since then, spurring an array of true crime podcasts, movies and television shows.\nWhat does the Karen Read verdict mean?\nBy not convicting Read of second-degree murder, the jury appeared to find that Read did not intentionally kill O’Keefe out of anger, as prosecutors suggested.\nBecause she was convicted on the lesser charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, Read will serve one year probation.\nHow did Karen Read's case unfold?\nThrough more than seven weeks of testimony, jurors heard from a myriad of witnesses and experts who testified about the events leading up to O’Keefe death, evidence found at the crime scene and irregularities in the investigation.\nOne of the biggest bombshells came near the beginning of the trial, when a friend of O’Keefe’s alleged that Read said, “I hit him, I hit him, I hit him,” shortly after finding his body beneath a pile of snow. Prosecutors paired the testimony with video clips of Read where she talked about being inebriated behind the wheel and questioned whether she could have “clipped” O’Keefe.\nMore in U.S.\nForensic scientists presented jurors with analysis of phone and vehicle data showing Read’s SUV moving 87 feet in reverse at about the same time O’Keefe’s phone locked for the last time. They showed pictures of tiny red bits of plastic stuck in the fabric of O’Keefe’s sweatshirt, and pieces of Read’s taillight near where his body was found.\nText messages between Read and O’Keefe in the days and hours before his death revealed their privately fraying relationship, despite public shows of affection.\n“Tell me if you're interested in someone else, can’t think of any other reason you are like this,” Read wrote at one point. O’Keefe replied: “Things haven't been great between us for a while. Ever consider that?”\nRead’s defense team at every turn sought to sow doubt in the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses and the integrity of the investigation into O’Keefe’s death. They alleged that the lead detective in O’Keefe’s case, former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was biased against Read, citing crude text messages he sent to friends, and questioned whether he planted the pieces of taillight at the crime scene.\nOne defense expert suggested that O’Keefe’s injuries were caused by a dog, backing up the defense’s theory that O’Keefe was beaten inside the home of a fellow cop, attacked by his dog and discarded outside during a blizzard.\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Karen Read found not guilty of second-degree murder charge",
            "Trauma-informed nurses help sexual assault survivors. Most hospitals don’t have them.. 5:00\nNews Story\nTrauma-informed nurses help sexual assault survivors. Most hospitals don’t have them.\nIllustration by Nolen Strals for the Gulf States Newsroom and Type Investigations\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Springboard Project at Type Investigations, with support from the Gertrude Blumenthal Kasbekar Fund.\nEditor’s Note: This story contains descriptions of sexual assault which may be disturbing to some readers.\nJulie Ford doesn’t remember everything about her assault. She remembers being tired as she neared the end of her usual jogging route atop the Mississippi River levee in New Orleans. She remembers passing someone sitting on a bench. She remembers being “tackled like a football player.”\nThe rest comes in flashes. Fighting him off. Dragging herself through the dirt. Calling for help. Her husband, bystanders, and EMTs carrying her broken body to the ambulance, which couldn’t get to her on the river side of the levee.\nShe remembers pleading to be taken to West Jefferson Medical Center, a hospital she knew took her insurance. She didn’t know it yet, but her hip had been dislocated, nose broken and her arm broken so badly EMTs described it as being in the shape of a question mark.\nBecause she’d been assaulted, she remembers being told she had to be taken to a specific hospital to receive a forensic exam — sometimes called a “rape kit.” While a range of clinicians can conduct forensic exams, specialized nurses called sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) receive rigorous training to provide trauma-informed care throughout the evidence collection and examination process. SANEs also connect survivors with resources and advocates.\nSANEs and the advocates they connect survivors with are vital for trauma-informed patient care and for bringing perpetrators of sexual assault to justice. But there is a critical shortage of SANEs across the Gulf South. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, a trade group that certifies SANEs, Alabama has 44 certified SANEs for the entire state. Louisiana has 42. Mississippi only has 6 — for a population of almost three million.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nWhere and how sexual assault patients access this resource varies greatly across the region. Although Louisiana state law requires patients have access to forensic exams in every parish, in practice not every hospital is set up to provide them. Instead, sexual assault survivors are often funneled to specific hospitals with SANEs tasked with delivering this specialized care In the New Orleans area, one of those facilities is University Medical Center, the hospital where Ford said she was taken, even though it wasn’t in her insurance network.\nWhat followed was another blur. She said she was put in a triage area that was “very public.” There, a detective asked her the same questions she’d already answered for patrol officers. She didn’t know where her husband was or why her leg felt like it “fell off.” She said nobody would tell her what was happening.\nShe was confused and scared — until she was greeted by an advocate from Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response (STAR), a group that works with survivors, and a sexual assault nurse examiner.\nIt was the first time she felt that somebody was here to help her, she said. SANEs are trained to reach out to advocates to sit with patients like Ford while they conduct a forensic medical exam, collecting evidence that could be used in prosecution.\nIt would take almost a decade before Ford’s attacker would be convicted for assaulting her. Patients can’t be charged for forensic exams in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama under state law. In Louisiana, hospitals are reimbursed up to $1,600 for a forensic exam from the state’s Crime Victims Reparations fund.\nBut this only covers the forensic exam — not the costs related to any additional injuries. Ford said for the one night she spent in the UMC emergency department, she was charged about $20,000 for medical care related to her severe injuries, which still haven’t fully healed.\nFord said she and her husband spent months making phone calls to their insurance company, and, after tearfully recounting what happened to her over and over, eventually, they were able to get most of the bills to be considered in-network. She ended up paying more than $2,300 out of pocket for medical bills, as well as around $1,000 for the ambulance ride.\n“The only thing in the system that I think worked in my entire experience was that piece, the forensic medical exam and the advocate piece,” Ford said. “I felt very lucky to have that.”\nAfter her assault, Ford stayed in touch with her advocate from STAR and used their hotline, support groups, and legal program for guidance and support. She’s had two surgeries and years of physical therapy related to her injuries.\nShe’s also become an advocate for other survivors. She now volunteers with Crime Survivors NOLA, which produces a free guidebook of resources for people dealing with the aftermath of violent crime. She said the practice of sending sexual assault survivors to another facility if they want a forensic exam is a huge barrier.\n“It might take a lot for that person to walk into a hospital, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to get done what they need to get done,” Ford said.\n“Just telling somebody that they have to go somewhere else, that might be the difference between that report getting taken or not getting taken.”\nSANE training\nWhen it comes time for her to introduce herself, nurse Gennie Cochran answers the icebreaker questions scrawled on the whiteboard like almost every other nurse in the small, brightly-lit room down the hall from the ICU at Ochsner Rush Medical Center in Meridian, Mississippi.\nShe’s originally from Mississippi, but she worked at West Jefferson Medical Center in Louisiana — the hospital Ford begged paramedics to take her to — from 2016 up until February, when she moved to Ochsner Rush.\n“I’m always tired,” she says with a laugh. The other nurses in the room nod in understanding.\nCochran and six other nurses and nurses-in-training from across the region are here for a week-long training to become SANEs. This is day one.\nThe last icebreaker question on the board is: Why am I taking this course?\n“This course is very near and dear to my heart,” Cochran says, tearing up as she explains that her daughter was assaulted when she was 13. She says it changed her daughter’s life and Cochran wants to be able to care for survivors. She wants to “make sure it’s done right, so they can’t throw it out in court.”\nShalotta Sharp, one of the SANEs helping to run the training, thanks Cochran for sharing her experience. After a short break, the group reconvenes and Sharp poses a question.\n“How many of you learned about the SANE program or SANE nursing or forensic nursing in nursing school?” Sharp asks.\nNo one, including Cochran raises their hand.\n“Me either,” Sharp says, cutting through the tension in the quiet room. “Forensic nursing is the best kept secret in the nursing community, in my opinion.”\nMany of the nurses at the training came because the hospital where they work doesn’t have a SANE. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, only 17-20% of American hospitals do. They want to be able to conduct forensic exams and provide trauma-informed care to their patients.\n“I work in small hospitals,” says nurse Jane Koen, who drove in for the SANE training from Choctaw County, Alabama. “We don’t have that in our small counties, so I just wanted to try to do it.”\nUnder the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, anyone who comes to an emergency room must receive an initial exam, called a medical screening, where they’re checked for serious injuries and made sure they’re stable. The law also guarantees emergency care to anyone, whether or not they have insurance or the ability to pay.\nBut Koen said that if sexual assault patients come ot the hospital where she works and want a forensic exam, they have to be transferred to another facility in Mississippi. It’s about an hour’s drive by car.\n“We tell them, ‘We don’t do that here,’” she said.\nGuns kill more U.S. children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds\n‘A huge impediment’\nIn interviews nurses, advocates, and legal experts from Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, recounted instances where patients couldn’t access forensic exams at their local hospital. Instead, they were transferred or referred elsewhere: sometimes across town, across the state, or across state lines. Sometimes, survivors drive themselves.\nExactly how often patients have to travel to receive this care isn’t clear because transfers like these are not tracked in public data. In some parts of Louisiana, regional policy states hospitals can transfer patients to a facility where a SANE is available.\nNaomi Jones, a former prosecutor — who prosecuted survivor Julie Ford’s case — in New Orleans, said having to travel to another hospital to get a forensic exam is a “huge impediment.”\nJones laid out a hypothetical timeline a survivor could face: they go out one evening around 7 or 8 p.m., an assault happens between 12 and 3 a.m., they make the decision to go to a hospital that doesn’t have a SANE around 5 or 6 a.m., get their initial exam around 9 a.m., and are then told they need to go to another facility if they want a forensic exam. And it could be several hours later before the forensic exam begins, which can take as long as six hours to complete.\n“At this point, that person has been up and awake for well over 24 hours,” Jones said. “They have been brutalized. They have already been prodded.”\nWhen a patient is told they need to go to another facility, in Louisiana, there isn’t a system in place that tracks whether or not they make it to that facility. Because this data isn’t collected, there’s no way to know how many sexual assault survivors choose not to go through with getting a forensic exam.\nUMC in New Orleans houses Louisiana’s largest SANE unit and many surrounding parishes send patients there for forensic exams. If an assault occurs in neighboring St. John the Baptist Parish, for example, the patient could be sent to UMC — potentially over an hour away — to meet with a SANE.\nOne SANE at UMC, Heidi Tujague, said when a patient is transferred, she gets a phone call from another hospital saying to expect a patient for a forensic exam. She reaches for a sticky note and jots down their basic information.\n“I’ve had sticky notes with just a name and a birthday,” Tujague said. After a week or so, if a patient doesn’t come in, she has to throw the neon-colored squares away.\n‘Double-edged sword’\nIn the 1970s, nurses across the U.S. came together, recognizing the need for specialized care for sexual assault patients, and started the first SANE programs with the aim of improving care for patients as well as the quality of evidence collection for prosecution.\nThe nurses who developed these programs likely did not envision a future where lack of access to a SANE could jeopardize medical care and legal recourse for survivors of sexual assault — a “double-edged sword” as SANE-trainer Shalotta Sharp called it.\nSharp said any nurse can conduct a forensic exam by using a SAFE kit. But this can pull a nurse off an emergency room floor for several hours. Many hospitals are already understaffed, and having fewer staff available can lead to increased wait times, higher rates of patients leaving the hospital without being seen and more medical errors.\nThe evidence may also not be as high-quality, and there’s the risk of retraumatizing the patient if the nurse isn’t specially trained to work with survivors of sexual assault. And, according to Sharp, many nurses are worried about having to testify in court if a case goes to trial.\nOn the first day of the SANE training in Meridian, Mississippi, Sharp explained that administering the SAFE kit was a small fraction of what they would learn.\n“What you are going to be learning about is what this patient looks like, how to recognize this patient, how to talk to this patient, how to document the findings you see on this patient,” Sharp said. “How to engage with this patient. How to listen. Listen to that patient and actually hear what is being said.”\nAdvocates say this approach is critical for sexual assault survivors, many whom come into a hospital physically and emotionally injured, distrustful, and scared.\n“You’re dealing with trauma,” said Kimberly Young, who runs Hearts of Hope, a sexual assault resource center in Lafayette, Louisiana. “You need people like Shalotta [Sharp] in that room who are trauma-informed and know how to handle trauma.”\nJencie Olivier, the sexual assault response center coordinator at Hearts of Hope, recently started keeping track of patients who said hospitals turned them away. Since January, she’s recorded seven instances. “They’re saying, ‘We’re not trained and able to do this’ and ‘Can you call Hearts of Hope?’”\nThose patients went to the Hearts of Hope facility, where they were able to meet with a SANE and get forensic exams.\nThe trauma-informed care SANEs provide also includes immediately contacting a local advocacy group to send someone to the hospital to sit with the patient, comfort them, advocate for them, explain the process, and connect them to any resources they might need, like support groups or legal assistance.\nThat’s all if the patient wants it. Consent is another huge aspect of a forensic exam conducted by a SANE, who explains each step before they do it and asks the patient for their permission before proceeding. If a patient doesn’t want to be swabbed or want photographs of certain areas, for instance, SANEs respect their choices.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nBetter legal outcomes\nJones, the prosecutor, says SANEs are better at what’s called the “chain of custody,” which refers to the process by which evidence is properly collected and transported so it’s not damaged or contaminated.\n“Chain of custody is incredibly important and [SANEs are] trained to do it and they’re good at it,” said Jones, the former prosecutor. “And that helps preserve the evidence. And evidence finds the truth.”\nJones said that when a prosecutor is making a decision about whether or not they’re going to go forward with a sexual assault case, part of that process includes looking at whether or not there’s enough evidence. “It absolutely makes for a stronger case against a defendant when you have medical evidence,” she said. “It makes a difference — a massive difference.”\nResearch supports this as well. A 2018 report on sexual assault and the availability of forensic examiners from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that forensic exams conducted by people trained to perform them “may result in better physical and mental health care for victims, better evidence collection, and higher prosecution rates.”\nSimilarly, a 2006 study by the American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College found that involving a SANE or a sexual assault response team in a case could contribute to higher survivor participation in the legal process, increased suspect identification and arrests, and greater likelihood of conviction.\nSANEs don’t just play a role on the evidentiary side of a sexual assault case. Because of their specialized training, they can also be qualified as experts and testify in court. Survivor Julie Ford said the testimony of the SANE that examined her was “completely critical for the case.”\nTraveling SANEs\nAnother reason why there aren’t enough SANEs is that there aren’t enough nurses. There’s currently a shortage of working nurses in the U.S., driven by factors such as a reduction in nursing program enrollments and working conditions. Concerns about adequate pay and workplace safety have driven many nurses to leave the profession.\n“We have a national surplus of nurses, believe it or not. There are more than enough nurses,” said Michelle Mahon with National Nurses United, the largest nursing union in the country. “What is lacking is the nurses who are willing to work in the conditions of care that have been created by the industry.”\nRather than transfer patients between facilities, some regional health districts in Louisiana have adopted a “traveling SANE” model, where the specialized nurses come to the patients, when availability allows. For example, in Region 7, which encompasses nine parishes in the northwestern part of the state, if a patient presents to a hospital that doesn’t have a SANE, the hospital will request one be sent to that facility to meet with them and conduct a forensic exam when and if the patient requests one. In instances where no SANE is available, an emergency department physician can perform the exam.\nMorgan Lamandre is president and CEO of Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response (STAR) — the organization that sent a volunteer to sit with survivor Julie Ford after her assault — which has offices in three different locations in Louisiana, one with a hospital-based SANE program at UMC and two with traveling SANE programs. She said removing the travel barrier increases the likelihood that a survivor will get a forensic exam.\n“From our perspective, the model is the traveling program because it doesn’t matter where a survivor presents to a hospital, the SANE comes to them,” Lamandre said. “Who knows how long it took them to get to the point of the hospital where they were being discharged to go to another hospital and to relive and tell a million people all over again what happened to them. Sometimes they just say it’s not worth it.”\nOther advocates agree that bringing SANEs to patients can help alleviate the barriers to accessing a forensic exam.\n“Without a doubt, whenever you have a survivor that’s faced with an obstacle like that, they’re less likely to get a forensic exam,” said Rafael de Castro, executive director of the Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault, a nonprofit that works with rape crisis centers in the state.\n“Whenever you can break down obstacles for survivors to get the services that they need, you’re always going to see an increase,” de Castro said.\nDe Castro said this impact goes deeper than getting a forensic exam or medical care in the moment. SANEs connect survivors to local sexual assault centers and advocates who can provide long-term services like individual or group counseling, legal assistance, and other forms of support.\n“If a survivor doesn’t know that those services are available,” de Castro said, “then they don’t get those services.” Studies show sexual assault survivors are at a higher risk for suicide. “It’s a life-lasting impact when those services are not there for a survivor.”\n‘Compassion fatigue’\nWhile they can benefit patients, traveling SANE programs can stretch thin the capacity of SANEs in the region they serve. Jefferson Parish only has two full-time traveling SANEs — which can also mean patients have to wait longer for a SANE to get to them.\nAdditionally, when the St. Tammany Parish coroner, Christopher Tape, fired all of the SANEs his office employed, which provided care for residents of five parishes, the two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs picked up the workload.\nTape said in a press statement he believed the SANE program was “illegal” because St. Tammany parish taxpayers paid for services provided to four neighboring parishes. But a former St. Tammany parish coroner said it did not pose a significant financial burden and that it was largely funded through grants and federal funds. (According to a WWL investigation, Tape was previously indicted on charges that he sexually assaulted a minor, though the charges were later quashed after the court found the state had violated his right to a speedy trial. He also settled a 2022 civil complaint from a female employee who accused him of “unwanted advances.”)\nThe two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs now cover 19 hospitals in six parishes, an area of 3,659 square miles with a population of more than a million people — larger than the state of Delaware and nearly the population of the state of Montana.\nThe workload of traveling SANEs can take a toll on the nurses themselves. Being a SANE is already difficult and demanding work. With the shortage, there are even more patients who need their care.\n“Honestly, a lot of us that have been doing this have been doing it a while and we are very much on our last leg,” Ginesse Barrett, one of the two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs said in a February 26 Louisiana Sexual Assault Oversight Commission meeting.\nSexual assaults often do not occur during normal business hours. SANEs can get calls in the middle of the night to go to a hospital and meet with a survivor who has been recently traumatized. Heidi Tujague, a SANE at UMC in New Orleans, said many nurses have stopped being SANEs due to burnout — what she called “compassion fatigue.”\n“I’ve seen nurses who only last a year or two because they just cannot handle the extra trauma they’re experiencing,” Tujague said.\nTeleSANEs\nHealth care providers are exploring another potential solution for addressing the SANE shortage and the barrier travel imposes on survivors: telemedicine. A teleSANE can video call into a hospital exam room and guide an emergency nurse through a forensic exam. SANEs can be recruited from across the country under this model.\nHospitals in some states do use teleSANE programs. Shalotta Sharp, the SANE trainer in Mississippi, works remotely as a teleSANE in Arkansas. But she says she can’t do this work in her own state or in neighboring Alabama and Louisiana, which currently do not have any teleSANE programs.\nSherrie Searcy-Lyle, a SANE at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who helped start the teleSANE program in Arkansas, said the travel barrier to patients and the shortage of SANEs in the area — she said Arkansas only had four certified SANEs before — were huge factors influencing their decision to start a program.\n“It eliminates that need to transport patients outside of their community unless they choose to do that,” Searcy-Lyle said. The teleSANE program is now in 27 hospitals across the state, she said.\n“I know that we’ve made an impact on making things happen for patients that would not have happened before without teleSANEs,” Searcy-Lyle said.\nBut not all nurses feel that telemedicine is the solution to the problem of a shortage of SANEs.\n“It’s very tempting to say, ‘Let’s look at this alternative model,’” said Michelle Mahon with National Nurses United. “The comparison is nothing or this . . . Nothing is unacceptable. But why are we not demanding what patients need?”\nHigh turnover exacerbates staffing needs at Louisiana’s child welfare agency, audit finds\nMahon said telehealth can’t replace the in-person care that’s vital for patients, especially survivors of sexual assault. Some research supports this. In an evaluation of a temporary teleSANE model deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, teleSANEs noted challenges in reading patients’ nonverbal cues and body language, which made it harder to ensure they were meeting their needs.\nOne clinician emphasized the importance of touch in sexual assault care: “It’s hard when you can’t reach out and touch somebody. Put a gentle hand on someone’s arm or whatever. That’s the part I didn’t like the most.”\nNon-SANE clinicians who participated in the research also highlighted the limitations of telehealth in creating human connections. As one described: “The [teleSANE] nurse on the iPad wasn’t there to hold [the patient’s] hand or talk to her face-to-face. I was the bridge, holding her, letting her cry on me. I know it was COVID-19 and we weren’t supposed to be close, but she was crying on my shoulder.”\nFunding and the future\nSome nurses say that teleSANEs can seem like attractive options for hospitals because fewer nurses can cover a wider area, which is less expensive than having a certified SANE nurse on-site in every community. But that doesn’t address the underlying factors contributing to the shortage of SANEs, and nurses more broadly, says Michelle Mahon with NNU.\nThis goes beyond pay increases, Mahon said. Nurses primarily leave the industry for three reasons. The first is what she called “moral injury”: working in an environment where nurses feel that they don’t have enough resources or support to provide the care they feel their patients need.\nThe second reason is understaffing, which puts more of a burden on the nurses that do choose to remain in the practice. The third is workplace violence: In 2023, NNU surveyed 1,000 nurses from across the country — nearly half reported an increase in workplace violence in the previous year.”\nPart of that underinvestment includes limited access to SANE trainings, which nurses often have to pay for themselves. Courses can range in cost from $350 to $600, though some organizations, like the one Shalotta Sharp works for, offer the education for free.\nSANE programs operate in different ways depending on regional policy. Some programs in Louisiana, like Jefferson Parish, are run by the parish coroner’s office. Some are run by the individual hospital, like UMC, a public hospital with funding from the state of Louisiana.\nIn Louisiana, the state budget does not directly allocate funds to SANE programs.\nIn the February 26 Louisiana Sexual Assault Oversight Commission meeting, Louisiana State Senator Beth Mizell said there’s an “incredible disconnect” with state legislators and the severity of the issue.\n“They think that the numbers are minute, they don’t realize the amount of victims that we’re talking about,” Mizell said. “It doesn’t even have to be money problems. It’s whether that’s going to be a priority or whether it’s always gonna be something that if we have extra money and you ask nice, maybe I’ll give you a little bit of it.”\nIn Louisiana, if the cost of the forensic exam exceeds the $1,600 reimbursed from the Crime Victims Reparations Fund, the hospital has to absorb the additional costs. Hospitals and healthcare providers with limited resources may not have the “extra buffer” to absorb the potential costs of conducting forensic exams, and a significant part of that can be paying for specialized nursing staff, said Monica Taylor, director of the Louisiana Governor’s Office on Human Trafficking Prevention.\nThe SANE training that Shalotta Sharp helps lead in Mississippi is provided free-of-charge by the Mississippi Coalition Against Sexual Assault. But in order to attend, nurses have to take time off work and pay for their own travel, hotels, and food — along with other potential costs such as childcare arrangements.\nThis difficulty in accessing SANE-training can dissuade nurses from getting it. And as more nurses leave the profession or retire and fewer enroll in nursing school or re-join the industry, there may be even fewer SANEs available to patients.\nEven though she didn’t have a choice where to go, Julie Ford said her experience with a SANE and an advocate at UMC was “the one thing in my situation that functioned the way it was supposed to.”\nShe doesn’t know if she would have chosen to go to West Jefferson Medical Center, where her medical care would have been covered by her insurance, or to go to UMC so she could get a forensic medical exam. But she wondered why that could have been a choice she would have to make in the first place — or why other survivors might have to choose to go to another hospital if they want a forensic exam.\n“If you put the ability to have forensic medical exams at every medical facility that would give people that kind of control that I think they deserve in that situation,” Ford said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story was produced by the Gulf States Newsroom — a collaboration between Mississippi Public Broadcasting, WBHM in Alabama, WWNO and WRKF in Louisiana and NPR.

            "Erin Patterson could have eaten same lunch as guests and suffered less severe poisoning, defence says. Erin Patterson’s barrister says the jury in her triple murder trial cannot be convinced she did not eat the same beef wellingtons as her lunch guests, and should ignore evidence from the only other survivor of the meal that she served herself on a different coloured plate.\nColin Mandy SC also said in his closing address that Patterson was “not on trial for being a liar”, and warned jurors against using “dangerous and seductive” hindsight reasoning to find her guilty.\nPatterson, 50, is facing three charges of murder and one of attempted murder in the Victorian supreme court.\nThe charges relate to the alleged deliberate poisoning of four lunch guests with beef wellingtons served at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023.\nPatterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering the relatives of her estranged husband, Simon Patterson – his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and aunt, Heather Wilkinson – and attempting to murder his uncle, Ian Wilkinson, Heather’s husband.\nAt the Latrobe Valley law courts in Morwell on Wednesday, Mandy said there was evidence that allowed the jury to find Patterson suffered death cap mushroom poisoning, as her guests had done, but that she suffered less severe poisoning.\nHe said this could have been due to her age, weight of more than 100kg, the fact she threw up hours after the lunch because she felt bloated, and the different toxic response of individuals.\nThis conclusion, that Patterson suffered a lower grade of poisoning, was supported by the evidence of Dimitri Gerostamoulos, Victoria’s chief toxicologist, Mandy said.\nThe prosecution alleges Patterson did not eat the same beef wellingtons as her guests, and was appearing to be sick after the lunch to avoid suspicion.\nMandy said the jury should also find that if Patterson was lying about vomiting after binge eating cake after the lunch, then she would have changed her story to more clearly benefit her.\nIf she was lying, Mandy said, Patterson would not have said she vomited hours after the lunch, but rather immediately after the guests left, and she would have also given evidence that her vomit contained beef wellington, rather than saying she did not know.\nMandy, asking the jury to pardon the pun, said they should be careful about how they considered the “colourful” evidence about the plates used to serve the lunch.\nHe said they should find Ian was “honestly mistaken” when he gave evidence the guests were served on a matching set of four grey plates, while Patterson served herself on a smaller coloured plate.\nMandy said the evidence of Simon, Patterson’s children, a friend of her son’s, and the footage of the police warrant shown in court was consistent about no such plates being used.\nMandy twice said that Patterson was not on trial for being a liar, once in reference to her behaviour after the lunch, and another in reference to misleading her lunch guests about having cancer.\nThe earlier reference came as Mandy was expanding on what he considered the fifth overarching theme of his closing address: hindsight reasoning.\nHe had flagged there were only expected to be four such themes on Tuesday: the “flawed approach” taken by the prosecution to the evidence, the honestly mistaken memory of witnesses, the burden of proof, and the duty of fairness incumbent on the prosecution.\n“This is not a court of moral judgment, you can’t, you shouldn’t, take a leap from this lie about a lump on her elbow to finding her guilty of triple murder,” Mandy said.\n“Those two things are a long way apart.”\nMandy said the prosecution theory that Patterson lied to her lunch guests about having cancer because she knew the lie would “die with them”, or, as he described it, would take it “to their graves” was an “illogical and irrational theory”.\n“It’s not a good thing … misleading people about whether you’ve got cancer, but it’s got nothing to do with any intention to kill or to harm them,” Mandy said.\nMandy also said the prosecution theory that Patterson wanted Simon at the lunch so that he could be killed was “absurd”.\nHindsight reasoning was dangerous and seductive, Mandy said, as it distorted how people evaluated decisions and actions that occurred in the past.\n“Whatever Erin Patterson’s intention was when she served the meal, is what it was,” he said.\n“It’s the prosecution’s job to prove what the accused actually did, and not to engage in hypothetical comparisons about what you or someone else might do in the same situation.\n“Things seem obvious in retrospect, but that’s not the right way of approaching it.”\nMandy went on to say that certain evidence can seem sinister in hindsight, and provide a “false clarity about ambiguous situations”.\nBad outcomes also made reasonable possibilities seem less plausible, he said.\nHe described the prosecution’s case in relation to Patterson picking death cap mushrooms in Loch after a post was made on iNaturalist, and then using her dehydrator to dry them, as “speculation upon speculation upon speculation”.\nThe court has been told that Patterson’s phone data suggested she may have stopped in Loch after the posts were made, and that photos of mushrooms shown on electronic scales appeared consistent with death caps.\nMandy also said to the jury, in a section of his address where he asked them to consider the evidence about why Patterson’s children were not at the lunch: “What’s more likely? That she wanted to kill everyone, or that she wanted to reconnect with her family for the sake of her children?”\nMandy’s closing address will resume on Thursday.\nThe jury was told by Justice Christopher Beale earlier this week that he did not expect to finish his directions to them in the case before next Tuesday afternoon."

            "Trump says Rand Paul is invited to White House picnic after senator said he wasn’t. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that \"of course\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was invited to an annual White House picnic, one day after the senator said he had been barred from the event.\n\"Of course Senator Rand Paul and his beautiful wife and family are invited to the BIG White House Party tonight,\" Trump said on Truth Social Thursday morning.\nPaul said on Wednesday that he was \"uninvited\" to an annual White House picnic typically attended by members of Congress and their families, framing the move to reporters Wednesday as retribution for his opposition to key components of President Donald Trump's agenda.\n“They’re afraid of what I’m saying, so they think they’re going to punish me, I can’t go to the picnic, as if somehow that’s going to make me more conciliatory,” Paul said on Wednesday. “So it’s silly, in a way, but it’s also just really sad that this is what it’s come to. But petty vindictiveness like this, it makes you — it makes you wonder about the quality of people you’re dealing with.”\nTrump said in Thursday's post that Paul's attendance would give \"me more time to get his Vote on the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill, one of the greatest and most important pieces of legislation ever put before our Senators & Congressmen/women.\" Paul has been a leading critic of the Trump-backed bill because of its projected to increase the national deficit.\nNBC News has reached out to Paul's office for comment on whether he has received an invitation. After Trump's comments, Paul posted a picture to X of him and his grandson, who was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n\"Turns out my grandson is actually invited to the Congressional Picnic!\" Paul said in the post. \"He is ready!\"\nPaul, who said he attended picnics hosted by Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told reporters on Wednesday that he called the White House to secure tickets to the annual picnic but was told he was not invited. He said he had family members flying to Washington to attend the event, including his son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-old grandson, who he noted owns a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n“I just find this incredibly petty,” Paul told reporters. \"I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been an intellectual opponent, a public policy opponent, and he’s chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic and to say my grandson can’t come to the picnic.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether Paul was ever invited to the event and whether Trump was directly involved in the decision to \"uninvite\" him.\nAs Trump pushes Republicans to pass a package of measures to fund much of his domestic agenda by Independence Day, Paul is among the Senate Republicans poised to make that milestone unreachable, joining fiscal hawks in the party to balk at legislation the Congressional Budget Office estimates said would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit.\nIn addition to his belief that the funding package would \"explode the debt,\" Paul has criticized spending cuts in the bill as \"wimpy and anemic,\" called planned Medicaid changes in the legislation \"bad strategy\" and proposed cutting billions of dollars for Trump's border wall from the bill.\n“In private, there’s quite a few people in there who actually do think we could save some money and are open-minded to it and believe the administration should justify the numbers,” Paul told reporters after a two-hour meeting on the bill Wednesday. “Even if you’re supportive, and I am supportive of border security, but I’m just not supportive of a blank check.”\nPaul said this week he plans to vote no on the legislation and speculated Wednesday that that might be among the reasons the invitation was rescinded.\n“I’m arguing from a true belief and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse, and they choose to react by uninviting my grandson to the picnic,” Paul said. “I don’t know, I just think it really makes me lose a lot of respect I once had for Donald Trump.”\nTrump has frequently lashed out at Paul in response to the sustained opposition, deriding him on Truth Social for his criticisms.\n\"Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting 'NO' on everything, he thinks it’s good politics, but it’s not,\" Trump wrote last week.\nPaul has emerged as a chief critic of Trump’s fiscal policy, and he has intensely criticized his decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, arguing they will push the country into a recession.\nPaul, a libertarian conservative, was one of four Republican senators to back a Democratic resolution to block the implementation of Trump's Canadian tariffs, predicting at the time that the import penalties would \"threaten us with a recession\" and calling Trump's decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners \"a terrible, terrible idea.\" The effort has so far stalled in the House.\nPaul also joined Democrats in introducing a bipartisan resolution to undo the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump imposed on dozens of countries, this time by terminating the national emergency he declared to implement the global penalties, arguing that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority.\n“Tariffs are taxes, and the power to tax belongs to Congress—not the president. Our Founders were clear: tax policy should never rest in the hands of one person,” Paul said in a statement about the bipartisan effort. “Abusing emergency powers to impose blanket tariffs not only drives up costs for American families but also tramples on the Constitution. It’s time Congress reasserts its authority and restores the balance of power.”\nThat effort failed to pass the Senate.\nPaul's differences with Trump even extend to the military parade taking place Saturday, which he likened to parades in countries led by dictators.\n\"I wouldn't have done it,\" Paul said Tuesday. \"The images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea, we were proud not to be that.\"\nBut still, in the face of his criticisms of Trump, Paul appeared to view the rescinded invitation as a shock, noting that even Democratic lawmakers remain invited to the White House picnic.\n\"I think I’m the first senator in the history of United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,” Rand told reporters. \"Literally, every Democrat is invited, every Republican is invited, and to say that my family is no longer welcome, kind of sad, actually.”",

            "Pete Hegseth dodges on whether he'd abide by court decisions on sending forces to L.A.. What to know today\n- SENATOR REMOVED FROM EVENT: Political figures across the aisle have raised concerns after Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcefully removed from a Department of Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The White House condemned Padilla, describing his actions as a \"theater-kid stunt.\"\n- BILL SIGNING: President Donald Trump signed a bill that blocks a California rule that sought to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. The president delivered remarks on a wide-ranging list of topics, including his falling out with Elon Musk and deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to anti-immigration raid protests.\n- CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC: Members of Congress and their families will attend an annual picnic at the White House today. That potentially includes Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who Trump now said is invited to go after the senator said his invitation was canceled over his opposition to some of the president's policies.\n- HOUSE RESCISSIONS VOTE: The House narrowly passed a Republican bill canceling $9.4 billion in spending on the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and other programs, with the aim of codifying cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n- PETE HEGSETH TESTIMONY: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced questions from the House Armed Services Committee in his third appearance at a congressional hearing this week to discuss the Pentagon's budget request. Hegseth was pressed by Republicans and Democrats on plans to invade Greenland and Panama by force.\nJohnson heckled by House Democrats after calling Padilla's behavior \"wildly inappropriate\"\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson was heckled by a group of House Democrats after he called Sen. Alex Padilla's behavior \"wildly inappropriate\" during a gaggle with reporters.\n\"What I saw was agents asking him to quiet down so that you know, the Secretary, could continue her press conference,” Johnson said. “He refused to do so. What were they supposed to do?\"\n\"Why don’t you stand up for Congress?,” Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., yelled.\nAsked by a reporter if he had a response to the Democratic pushback, Johnson refused to respond, saying instead \"I think the American people can draw their own conclusion.\"\nThe House Speaker said formal disciplinary measure are up to the Senate, but that he thinks “that behavior, at a minimum, it rises to the level of a censure.”\nSen. Susan Collins says Padilla's removal from a DHS event is 'disturbing'\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it's \"hard to imagine a justification\" for the forced removal of Padilla from a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\"I think it’s very disturbing,\" Collins told NBC News. \"I don’t know what preceded it. I just was shown on the floor a small play, but it looks like he is being manhandled and physically removed and it’s hard to imagine a justification for that.”\nWhite House slams Padilla for 'theater-kid stunt' that led to handcuffing\nThe White House condemned Sen. Alex Padilla for interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles today, calling the senator's behavior \"immature\" and a \"theater-kid stunt.\"\n\"Padilla stormed a press conference, without wearing his Senate pin or previously identifying himself to security, yelled, and lunged toward Secretary Noem. Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.\nThe White House also slammed Democrats for their widespread anger over Padilla's subsequent handcuffing and removal, framing the uproar as misplaced.\n\"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt — but it’s telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA,\" the statement read.\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus chair calls for criminal investigation of officials involved in Padilla incident\nReporting from Washington\nRep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, this afternoon called for the arrest of the agents involved in the forced removal and handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., characterizing the incident as an \"assault.\"\n“We want a fast and full investigation on the assault of Senator Alex Padilla. That’s what we want. We want those people that assaulted him to be looked at and to be arrested,” Espaillat said, adding the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is \"fully behind\" Padilla.\nEspaillat said the incident was part of a broader effort by the administration to crack down on dissent, which he framed as a sign of a democracy in danger.\n“Anybody that sees the video will see that he was aggressively assaulted and thrown on the ground for simply just wanting to express his opinion or ask a question,\" Espaillat said. \"The censoring of dissent will put this democracy and has put this democracy in danger.\"\nSen. Gary Peters says forcible removal of Padilla was 'unacceptable'\nSen. Gary Peters of Michigan, a ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, this afternoon condemned the forcible removal of Padilla from a news conference.\n\"He was dragged out, taken out, because he was trying to ask a question -- thrown to the floor,\" Peters said in a video statement on X.\n\"It is absolutely unacceptable as a member of Congress, you have a right to ask questions, to stand up for the people that we represent, and what we saw today, is simply unacceptable,\" Peters added.\nCory Booker calls Padilla's handcuffing a 'pattern and a practice' by the Trump administration\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called the forcible removal and handcuffing of California Sen. Alex Padilla at a Department of Homeland Security news conference an \"abuse of authority\" by the Trump administration.\n\"It is a violent act, and there can be no justification of seeing a senator forced to their knees, laid flat on the ground, their hands twisted behind their back and being put into restraints,\" Booker said today on the Senate floor.\n\"This is a pattern and a practice, this is not an isolated incident,\" Booker added, referring to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in his state last month. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., who was indicted this week on federal charges in connection with the Newark incident, has said she was \"assaulted\" by multiple ICE agents while speaking with reporters outside of the facility.\n\"We see time and time again, with this administration, trying to precipitate a response by the misuse and the abuse of force,\" Booker said. \"This is more akin to authoritarian governments when you see a democratic nation having their executive begin to arrest mayors, begin to arrest judges, begin to arrest a United States senator who is simply asking for answers to their questions.\"\nKamala Harris condemns Padilla's removal from a DHS event, calling it 'abuse of power'\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Padilla's removal from a DHS event in a statement, calling it \"a stunning abuse of power.\"\n\"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration’s actions in Southern California,\" Harris wrote in a post on X. \"This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"\nPadilla replaced Harris in the Senate after she left to serve as vice president.\nSen. Alex Padilla says, \"We will hold this administration accountable\" after being removed from a Department of Homeland Security event.\nHouse Republicans vote to claw back $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid, NPR and PBS\nThe Republican-led House voted 214-212 on Thursday to pass a proposal from President Donald Trump to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved federal funding.\nThe “rescissions” package would claw back $8.3 billion for foreign aid and $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to NPR and PBS. It is part of an effort by the White House to codify cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which was helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk.\nTrump pushed GOP lawmakers to back the bill just ahead of the House vote, posting on social media, “The Rescissions Bill is a NO BRAINER, and every single Republican in Congress should vote, ‘YES.’ MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\nFour House Republicans voted with 208 Democrats to reject the measure. Some GOP members flipped their votes from “no” to “yes” toward the end after realizing it wouldn’t pass otherwise. (Four Democrats and two Republicans missed the vote.)\nThe package now heads to the Senate, where it isn’t subject to the 60-vote threshold, meaning Republicans can pass it along party lines.\nShouting match breaks out over Padilla incident at House hearing\nA lengthy GOP-led House Oversight Committee hearing on states’ immigration policies has focused increasingly over the last hour on the forcible removal of Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a news conference in Los Angeles after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\nAs the testy hearing entered its sixth hour, Democrats on the panel have repeatedly sought to bring attention to the incident, with many attempting to introduce news articles for the record documenting it.\nDuring one prolonged exchange, Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., repeatedly pressed Comer and other Republicans to commit to subpoenaing Noem.\n“Just shut up,” Comer replied, after moments of back-and-forth yelling.\nRep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said over the melee, “Democrats can’t follow the rules, can’t follow the law” as Frost continued to demand Comer’s attention.\nThe hearing took a brief recess after that.\nCuomo's mayoral campaign uses L.A. protest footage to go after Trump — and an opponent\nAndrew Cuomo’s campaign for mayor of New York has launched new digital ads on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram arguing that the former governor is the best candidate to take on Trump — using footage from the recent protests in Los Angeles to go after Zohran Mamdani, a state legislator and leading progressive candidate, for lacking experience.\n\"L.A. is in chaos. Imagine it’s Times Square. Trump’s coming for New York. Who do you think can stop him?\" the ad says. \"Zohran Mamdani is a 33-year-old, dangerously inexperienced legislator who’s passed just three bills with a staff you can fit inside a New York elevator.\"\n\"New York already has a crisis of affordability and safety. We need someone ready to roll,\" the ad continues. \"Andrew Cuomo has managed a state and managed crises — from Covid to Trump. Trump’s at the city gates. We need someone experienced to slam them shut.\"\n'Zero tolerance': DOJ official encourages prosecutors to use same laws used against Trump pardonees\nA Justice Department official encouraged top federal prosecutors across the country to pursue cases related to immigration protests, specifically listing many of the same laws that Jan. 6 defendants were charged under before they were mass pardoned by the president on the day of his inauguration.\n“Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,” the email said, adding that the department “has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.”\nIn the email to U.S. attorneys, first assistants and criminal chiefs that was seen by NBC News, the official listed several 13 laws prosecutors should consider. Those included several statutes that were used against Jan. 6 rioters, including those related to assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers or employees; civil disorder; and damage to government property. The message also mentions similar charges that Jan. 6 defendants faced, like obstruction of proceedings before departments and agencies, and picketing or parading with the intent to obstruct or impede the administration of justice.\nOne notable potential charge mentioned on the list is an incitement charge under the Anti-Riot Act that came up in discussions around Jan. 6 but was never deployed because it has faced setbacks in courts; various courts found components of the law unconstitutional and that it had a chilling effect on free speech.\nThat law was passed in 1968 as a rider to the Civil Rights Act, and was championed by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. The debate over the law specifically referred to prominent Black leaders, and the law was used against the Chicago Seven, but was more recently put to the test against white supremacists.\nAsked about the email, a Justice Department official said in a statement: “As we’ve said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.”\nSen. Rand Paul jokes that his MAGA hat-wearing grandson is invited to the congressional picnic\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joked in a post on X this afternoon that his grandson has been invited to the congressional picnic this evening at the White House.\nThe post included a photo of him and his young grandson, who was wearing a backward \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\nThe senator had said yesterday that he and his family were uninvited to the annual event, but Trump said on Truth Social this morning that the GOP senator was invited to the picnic.\nGOP Rep. David Valadao says the impact of ICE raids on migrant workers is 'really concerning'\nRep. David Valadao, R-Calif., told NBC News that the impact the Trump administration's ICE raids are having on migrant workers is \"really concerning.\"\nValadao said mass ICE raids would have a “huge impact” on his Central Valley district’s ability to “feed the country and, frankly, the rest of the world.”\n“We’ve reached out over this entire administration, talking about that, always trying to make sure that our voices were heard, that they understood that there are people who are applying to our community, and they play a lot of role in the nation, building housing, taking care of folks in all types of industries, and so we hope that that message got through,\" Valadao said. \"I know the president has made some positive comments in the past, but the actions over the last few weeks have been really concerning.\"\nValadao, who represents a politically competitive seat in California, wrote on X on Tuesday that he was “urging” the administration to focus on deporting criminals instead of the “hardworking people” in his district.\nNewsom calls Trump a 'stone-cold liar'\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called Trump a \"stone-cold liar\" in an episode of \"The Daily\" podcast that was released Thursday.\nNewsom, speaking with the New York Times podcast, spoke about the phone call he had with Trump on Friday evening, where he claimed that Trump did not discuss his plan to federalize the National Guard to quell anti-deportation protests in Los Angeles.\n\"It didn’t appear to me when I talked to him. He never brought it up. Period, full stop, he lied about that. Yeah, last Friday night. He lied. He lied. My mother and dad’s grave,\" Newsom told \"The Daily.\" \"I don’t mess around when I say this. He lied. Stone-cold liar. Don’t think for a second he told the truth. He lied.\"\nNewsom said he and Trump had a \"cordial\" chat in that phone call that barely touched upon the protests in Los Angeles, adding that Trump's decision to federalize the National Guard \"came completely out of left field.\"\nThe governor said that on Saturday, he was surprised to wake up to Trump's statements calling him \"Newscum.\"\n\"Then talks about the National Guard, and then starts making up all these things he claimed he told me about, which honestly starts to disturb me on a different level that maybe he actually believed he said those things,\" Newsom said.\n\"And he’s not all there. I mean that,\" the governor added.\nNewsom also spoke about Trump's decision to direct hundreds of Marines to Los Angeles, calling the move a \"red line.\"\n\"I think it’s a red line when you’re using military that are trained for foreign incursions to do domestic law enforcement in American cities,\" Newsom said. \"I think that’s a red line. If that’s not a red line, I don’t know what red lines mean. This is the United States military being used for domestic law enforcement.\"\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says the military 'should stay out of politics'\nRep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., used part of his time in the hearing on the Pentagon budget request to express concerns over politicization of the military.\nDeluzio asked Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, what military officials should do if an event they attend turns political. His question came after he sharply criticized Trump's comments to troops at Fort Bragg.\nCaine declined to weigh in.\n\"By even my engaging in answering this question, that is making my job involved in politics,\" he said. \"And so while I appreciate the question, I think the chairman and the force should stay out of politics.\"\nTrump is open to dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, White House says\nTrump “remains receptive” to communications with Kim Jong Un, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, even as the North Korean leader appears less interested in talks over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nTrump would “like to see the progress that was made at that summit in Singapore,” Leavitt told reporters yesterday, referring to the first in-person summit between the two leaders in 2018.\nLeavitt was responding to a question about a news report that said North Korea had refused to accept a letter from Trump that was intended to reopen channels of communication between Washington and Pyongyang.\nHer comments come as both North and South Korea appear to have suspended propaganda loudspeaker blasts at their shared border in an effort to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The two countries technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.\nKim has continued to make advancements in his weapons programs since his last meeting with Trump in 2019, and has been further strengthened by a security partnership with Russia.\nRep. Patrick Smith tells Hegseth he 'should resign'\nRep. Patrick Smith, D-N.Y., criticized what he painted as an infusion of politics into a military event when Trump delivered a speech at Fort Bragg this week.\nHe urged officials like Hegseth to \"continue to echo the apolitical nature\" of the military.\n\"Mr. Secretary, I don't say this lightly. I have to say this on the record. I think your tenure as secretary of defense has been shameful and weak, and you should resign,\" Smith said in concluding his remarks.\nTrump wraps White House event after nearly 90 minutes\nAfter nearly 90 minutes, Trump's bill signing event, which included an impromptu press conference with reporters, has ended.\nTrump says 'I don't feel like a king' when asked about 'No Kings' protests planned for Saturday\nTrump told reporters at the White House that he doesn't feel like a king when asked about so-called No Kings protests against his agenda that are planned to coincide with his military parade on Saturday.\n\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff,\" he said when asked about the protests.\nA king \"wouldn't have to call up [House Speaker] Mike Johnson and [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off,' and after years, we get it done,\" Trump said, referring to legislation to advance his agenda. \"No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all.\"\nTrump said his administration will address impact of its immigration policies on agriculture workforce\nTrump said his administration is “going to have to use common sense” to address the impacts of its hard-line immigration policies on the agriculture and tourism industries.\n“Our farmers are being hurt badly,” Trump said while speaking to reporters at the White House today. “We can’t take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don’t have, maybe what they’re supposed to have, maybe not.”\nTrump referenced a post he made on Truth Social this morning where he claimed farmers and business leaders have complained his immigration policies are harming their workforce and “taking very good, long-time workers away from them.” The president added that \"changes are coming.\"\n\"They end up hiring the people, the criminals that have come in, the murderers from prisons and everything else,\" Trump told reporters today.\n“We’re going to have an order on that pretty soon,” Trump said. “I think we can’t do that to our farmers and leisure to hotels. We’re going to have to use common sense.\"\nTrump said Elon Musk chose to support him despite his clear plans to slash EV incentives\nTrump said Elon Musk, who recently feuded with the president online over his proposed cuts to electric vehicle tax credits, still chose to endorse him despite his plans to slash the incentives.\n“I used to say, I’m amazed that he’s endorsing me, because that can’t be good for him. I’m abolishing the EV mandate,” Trump said during a bill signing at the White House today. “I once asked him about it. ... He said, ‘Well, as long as it’s happening to everybody, I’ll be able to compete.’ It’s a very interesting answer.”\nTrump claimed that Musk never advocated for the preservation of what he calls the electric vehicle mandate, a Biden-era EPA rule that sought to cut auto emissions and expand consumer access to electric vehicles.\n“He makes electric cars,” Trump said. “And we’re saying you’re not going to be able to make electric cars, or you’re not going to be forced to make all of those cars.”\nThe comments came as Trump prepared to sign legislation to block California’s plan to phase out gas-powered cars and end their sales by 2035. Musk last week attacked the Trump-backed GOP domestic policy bill over its impact on the federal deficit, calling it a “disgusting abomination.”\nThe Tesla CEO walked back his comments in a post on X yesterday, saying they “went too far.” Trump also moved the bright red Tesla he had been displaying outside of the White House in support of Musk, but said at today’s White House signing that he likes the cars.\n“He got a little bit strange,” Trump said of Musk, claiming, “but I don’t know why.”\nTrump says an Israeli strike on Iran is 'something that could very well happen'\nTrump said during a press availability at the White House that an Israeli strike on Iran could happen.\n\"I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen. Look, it’s very simple, not complicated,\" he told reporters when asked if an Israeli strike on Iran was imminent.\n\"Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,\" he continued. \"Other than that, I want them to be successful. I want them to be tremendous. We'll help them be successful. We'll trade with them. We'll do whatever is necessary.\"\nNBC News reported overnight that Israel is considering taking military action against Iran, five people with knowledge of the situation said, though it will likely happen without U.S. support.\nThe Trump administration has been trying to negotiate a deal that would curb Iran's nuclear program, but no agreement has been reached yet.\nTrump delivers campaign-style remarks during bill signing: 'I’d rather be electrocuted'\nTrump delivered a stem-winding speech that delved into tariffs, inflation rates, windmills, his election victory and more in the White House East Room during a bill signing to overturn California’s new ban on gas-powered vehicles. Boasting of ending green energy policies, Trump said that he had discussed his plans with his now-departed adviser, Elon Musk, founder of the electric vehicle company Tesla.\n“That’s why Elon doesn’t like me very much,” Trump quipped in reference to the pair’s recent public fallout. “But he actually does, he does,” he said, after Musk acknowledged in a social media post this week that he “went too far” in attacking Trump.\nTrump’s remarks were reminiscent of a campaign speech at times, as he wove through topics as diverse as the animal kingdom, combustion engines and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Of a potentially fearsome encounter with sharks, Trump mused, “I’d rather be electrocuted.”\nHe also offered praise for Lee Zeldin, his EPA administrator, and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, someone who he said “could destroy five nations with five calls,” in a testament to her influence.\nTrump calls Jerome Powell a 'numbskull' as he urges rate cut\nTrump called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell a “numbskull” during remarks at the White House today, urging him to lower interest rates.\n“I’m not going to fire him,” Trump said of Powell, but added that “all he has to do is to lower” rates.\n“What is he doing? Why doesn’t he lower these rates?” Trump said, repeating a common criticism he makes of Powell.\nIn a recent statement, Powell spoke out in defense of the independence of the Federal Reserve following pressure from Trump to cut interest rates. The chairman's comments followed a meeting with Trump last month where he said the two discussed “economic developments.”\nAsked whether men and women are both capable of killing, Hegseth says it 'depends on the context'\nAsked repeatedly by Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., whether both men and women are able to cause death, Hegseth responded several times that it \"depends on the context.\"\nHoulahan asked Hegseth whether both men and women were capable of pulling rifle triggers to cause death, to which Hegseth said, \"Sure.\" She then asked whether both men and women were capable of operating drones and launching missiles.\n\"I know what you're getting at, ma'am,\" he said as the two began talking over each other.\n\"Men and women carry equipment differently,\" Hegseth said, adding that there are physical differences between men and women.\nHoulahan continued, criticizing Hegseth's comments about different genders in the military. The defense secretary has said that women should not serve in combat roles, but has since walked back those comments.\n\"Lethality is equal parts technical skills, tactical experience, cognitive problem solving and physical fitness,\" Houlahan said. \"It's not about one person, but it's about many.\"\nHegseth dodges on whether he would abide by court decisions on Trump's response to L.A. protests\nHegseth flouted multiple questions from Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., over whether he would abide by court decisions on whether Trump can deploy troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles despite Newsom's objections.\n\"Whatever the federal district court decides, will you abide by it?\" Khanna asked.\nHegseth answered that it was a \"pending situation.\" Asked again, he said, \"What I will tell you is, my job right now is to ensure the troops that we have in Los Angeles are capable of supporting law enforcement.\"\nPressed again, Hegseth said, \"We've always looked to the decisions of the court.\"\nKhanna again urged Hegseth to assure people that he would respect Supreme Court and other federal court decisions on the issue.\n\"What I can say is we should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\" Hegseth said.\n\"So you're not willing to say you would respect those decisions?\" Hegseth asked.\n\"What I'm saying is, local district judges shouldn't make foreign policy for the United States,\" Hegseth said.\nNewsom dings Trump for saying farmers and business leaders are complaining about his immigration policies\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been clashing with Trump in recent days over the administration's hard-line immigration policies, continued to hammer against his deportation actions today.\nThe Democratic governor and potential 2028 presidential contender responded to Trump writing in a post on Truth Social that farmers and business leaders have complained to him that his immigration policies are \"taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and that \"changes are coming!\"\n“Turns out, chasing hard working people through ranches and farms and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,” Newsom wrote in a post on X.\nTwo police officers sue over failure to hang plaque honoring those who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6\nHarry Dunn and Daniel Hodges, two police officers who have been outspoken about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, have sued the architect of the Capitol over its failure to hang a plaque honoring officers who protected the building that day.\n\"They bring this suit to compel Congress to follow its own law and install the mandated memorial, to honor the women and men who saved the lives of those inside the building, and to ensure that the history of this attack on the Capitol — and on democracy — is not forgotten,\" the lawsuit says.\nCongress passed the law in 2022 to install the plaque on the western front of the U.S. Capitol and was signed by then-President Joe Biden. \"That was over three years ago,\" the suit says.\n\"While Congress has installed a memorial to other officers who died in a different tragedy, it has not installed the plaque to honor those who defended the Capitol on January 6,\" they say. \"Meanwhile, though Congress has not placed the memorial to the officers who protected it, members have managed to honor the man who inspired the violence,\" referring to Trump.\nDunn and Hodges argue that by not hanging the plaque, Congress is encouraging the \"rewriting of history.\" \"It suggests that the officers are not worthy of being recognized, because Congress refuses to recognize them.\"\nBrendan Ballou, lead attorney in the case and a former Jan. 6 prosecutor, said in a statement, “These plaintiffs, and the officers they stood beside, were literally the only thing that saved the democratic transfer of power that day, and democracy itself. And they saved countless lives of people inside the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol must follow the law, and must honor these officers, to prevent history from being rewritten.”\nThe architect of the Capitol, Thomas E. Austin, who was selected in 2024 by a bicameral congressional commission, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRep. Moulton and Hegseth clash over Signal chat\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., pushed Hegseth repeatedly on his involvement in a Signal group chat, where the defense secretary shared sensitive military information.\nMoulton pressed Hegseth on the classification level of the information he shared, and Hegseth deflected multiple questions.\n\"It's not classified to disclose whether or not it was classified, and in fact, DOD regulations state that any classified information has to be labeled with its classification, was it classified secret or top secret,\" Moulton said during their exchange.\n\"What's not classified is that it was an incredibly successful mission against the Houthis,\" Hegseth said.\nLater, Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would take accountability. Hegseth defended his actions in the chat, saying that he did not name targets, locations or methods. He also pivoted to saying that the Houthis were held accountable and praised U.S. troops.\nHegseth said multiple times that he serves at the pleasure of the president.\nTesty House committee exchange on sanctuary policies offers possible preview of 2026 New York governor race\nDuring a testy exchange at a GOP-led House Oversight Committee hearing over on states' immigration policies, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., grilled New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul — offering a possible preview of next year's gubernatorial race in the state.\nStefanik, who is considering a run for governor, is not a member of the committee. But the panel's chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., allowed several lawmkers to join in on the questioning of Hochul and Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and JB Priztker of Illinois.\nStefanik used the opportunity to attack Hochul, repeatedly bringing up instances of undocumented immigrants having committed crimes in in the state, saying that they were emblematic of “Kathy Hochul’s New York.”\n“No amount of words is going to clean up your failed record, and these horrific crimes committed in the sanctuary state that you created,” Stefanik said.\nIn what at times resembled potential campaign messaging, Stefanik said that the crimes were “one of the many reasons why you’re hemorrhaging support from hard working” New Yorkers.\n“We deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers, who doesn’t put illegals first, but actually puts New Yorkers first,” Stefanik continued.\nHochul hit back by saying that Stefanik was simply “going after the viral moment.\"\nRep. Mike Turner pushes Hegseth to clarify testimony on military plans for Greenland\nRep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, pushed Hegseth to clarify his earlier testimony about any military plans to invade Greenland.\n\"I just want to help you out because people try to twist your words. You are not confirming in your testimony today that at the Pentagon, there are plans for invading or taking by force Greenland, correct? That is not your testimony today?\" Turner asked.\n\"All my testimony is that the Pentagon has plans for any number of contingencies,\" Hegseth responded.\n\"It is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\" Turner asked again more forcefully. \"Because I sure as hell hope that it is not your testimony.\"\n\"We look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\" Hegseth said.\nRep. Adam Smith presses Hegseth on military plans to invade Greenland or Panama\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., pressed Hegseth repeatedly as to whether the military had plans to forcibly take over Greenland or the Panama Canal, areas that Trump has said he wants as part of the U.S.\n\"Is it the policy of the Department of Defense that we need to be prepared to take Greenland and Panama by force, if necessary?\" Smith asked.\nHegseth pivoted to talking about concerns over China's influence, prompting Smith to cut in and the two men to talk over each other when Hegseth emphasized the importance of the two countries.\nSmith said he was concerned over the possibility of the U.S. trying to take over the countries by force.\n\"Our job at the DOD is to have plans,\" Hegseth said.\n\"Do you have a plan for that?\" Smith asked.\n\"Our job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any particular contingency,\" Hegseth said.\nSmith asked Hegseth, \"To be clear, you do — you have plans to take Panama and Greenland by force if necessary.\"\n\"I think the American people would want the Pentagon to have plans for any particular contingency,\" Hegseth said.\n\"Not for that,\" Smith said.\nRep. Adam Smith: 'Can we please just stop and get back to the business of treating everybody equally and with respect?'\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., criticized the Defense Department's focus on culture war issues, calling out Hegseth's push against people like transgender troops serving in the armed forces.\n\"We are a diverse nation, we need to be inclusive and we need to not actively insult people who don't happen to fit our preconceived notion of what a member of the military should look like,\" Smith said.\nSmith slammed the administration for renaming military bases so they now share the names of Confederate soldiers.\n\"Can we please just stop and get back to the business of treating everybody equally and with respect?\" Smith asked.\nTrump says business leaders are saying that mass deportations are affecting their workforce\nIn a post on TruthSocial this morning, Trump said that he's heard from business leaders that his mass deportation agenda \"is taking very good, long time workers away from them.\"\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" the president wrote.\nHe added, \"In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\"\nTrump did not specify which business leaders and farmers have spoken with him and his administration about this.\nRep. Adam Smith criticizes focus on loyalty in government roles\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., criticized what he characterized as the administration's focus on ensuring staff loyalty to Trump.\n\"If you’re focused on loyalty, you’re not focused on competency, you’re not focused on ability, and it is the wrong way to go,\" said Smith, who is the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.\nSmith also criticized a slew of other White House actions, including plans to accept a Qatari jet to ultimately use as Air Force One.\n\"There’s all kinds of ethics problems with that,\" Smith said.\nPete Hegseth's hearing beguns\nHegseth is facing questions from the House Armed Services Committee this morning, his third appearance at a congressional hearing this week to discuss the Pentagon’s budget request. The hearing kicked off with statements from Chairman Mike Rogers.\nTrump adviser Stephen Miller to brief Senate Republicans today\nWhite House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller will brief Senate Republicans behind closed doors this morning about the GOP tax policy bill, according to a source familiar with the meeting.\nThe meeting is set to take place around 11 a.m. ET.\nIn the afternoon, the Senate will hold a confirmation vote for former Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., to serve as IRS commissioner, as well as a vote to advance the GENIUS Act, a crypto regulation bill.\nAustralia confident U.S. will proceed with AUKUS submarine deal after review\nReporting from Sydney\nAustralia’s defense minister said he was confident that the AUKUS submarine pact with the U.S. and Britain would proceed, and that his government would work closely with the U.S. while the Trump administration conducted a formal review.\nAustralia in 2023 committed to spend 368 billion Australian dollars ($239 billion) over three decades on AUKUS, the country’s biggest ever defense project with the U.S. and Britain, to acquire and build nuclear-powered submarines. A Pentagon official said the administration was reviewing AUKUS to ensure it was “aligned with the President’s America First agenda.”\nTrump says 'of course' Rand Paul is invited picnic after senator said he was uninvited\nTrump said on Truth Social that \"of course\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is invited to tonight's White House picnic, one day after the senator said that he and his family had been uninvited.\nPaul has frequently criticized the Trump-backed domestic policy bill, which is projected to increase the federal deficit.\n\"Of course Senator Rand Paul and his beautiful wife and family are invited to the BIG White House Party tonight. He’s the toughest vote in the history of the U.S. Senate, but why wouldn’t he be?\" Trump said in the post.\n\"Besides, it gives me more time to get his Vote on the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill, one of the greatest and most important pieces of legislation ever put before our Senators & Congressmen/women,\" the president added.\nTrump to sign measures to block California's gas vehicle phase-out\nTrump is expected to sign measures today aimed at blocking California's plan to phase out gas-powered cars, a White House official said.\nThe official also confirmed that the measures will do away with regulations phasing out the sale of diesel vehicles and reducing truck emissions, which The Associated Press previously reported.\nCalifornia had previously banned the sale of all new gas-powered cars by 2035 as part of an effort to fight climate change.\nHouse expected to vote on DOGE-backed cuts\nThe House will debate and vote on a Republican-led bill today that would claw back $9.4 billion in spending that had previously been approved.\nThe vote is scheduled for 3:15 p.m. ET.\nMost of the spending that Republicans are trying to rescind is related to foreign aid, but the legislation would also cut funding for public broadcasting services NPR and PBS. The bill aims to codify cost cuts that were suggested by the Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe bill needs support from a simple majority of House lawmakers to pass, after which it would go to the Senate for consideration.\nDavid Hogg won’t run for DNC post again after party orders redo of vice chair elections\nProgressive activist David Hogg said he won’t seek to continue as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after the DNC called for a redo of the February election that elevated him to the post.\nShortly after the DNC announced it would hold new elections Thursday for two vice chair positions held by Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as a result of a procedural challenge, Hogg announced he wouldn’t be a candidate.\n‘Incredibly petty’: Sen. Rand Paul says he was ‘uninvited’ to White House picnic over breaks with Trump\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was “uninvited” to an annual White House picnic typically attended by members of Congress and their families, framing the move to reporters today as retribution for his opposition to key components of Trump’s agenda.\n“They’re afraid of what I’m saying, so they think they’re going to punish me, I can’t go to the picnic, as if somehow that’s going to make me more conciliatory,” Paul said. “So it’s silly, in a way, but it’s also just really sad that this is what it’s come to. But petty vindictiveness like this, it makes you — it makes you wonder about the quality of people you’re dealing with.”\nSome far-left groups have encouraged peaceful protests to turn violent, experts say\nIt was approaching nightfall in Los Angeles on Sunday when black-clad demonstrators began to torch a row of self-driving Waymo taxis. Within minutes, videos of the fiery scenes began to pop up on social media.\n“MORE. MORE AND MORE AND MORE,” a group known as Unity of Fields posted on X, along with a video of the flaming vehicles.\nThe post wasn’t an anomaly. Since the start of the demonstrations against immigration raids in Los Angeles, the Unity of Fields X account has been pumping out messages urging people to wreak havoc in the streets and “give ‘em hell.”\nIt’s part of a far-left online ecosystem that has proliferated in recent years, experts say. Some of the groups behind the accounts express contempt for peaceful resistance and glorify acts of violence — and even murders, like those of the UnitedHealthcare CEO and two Israeli Embassy staffers."

Several eruptions sent ash up to 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon. An eruption Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds 10,000 meters (about 32,800 feet) into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 150 kilometers (nearly 93 miles) away.

The volcano has had several eruptions, and its danger level and no-go zone have changed several times before being raised again to the highest level Tuesday. An eruption of Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in November killed nine people and injured dozens. It also erupted in March. Indonesia is an archipelago of 270 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. Tarigan reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.

            "Senate Republicans hold hearing on Biden's mental fitness as Democrats boycott. Senate Republicans hold hearing on Biden's mental fitness as Democrats boycott\nRepublican senators are looking into former President Joe Biden's ability to serve in office\nWASHINGTON -- Nearly six months after Joe Biden left the White House, Senate Republicans are still scrutinizing his presidency, kicking off the first in what's expected to be a series of congressional hearings this year on his mental fitness in office.\nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee brought in three witnesses Wednesday — none of whom served in Biden's administration — to scrutinize his time in office, arguing that Biden, his staff and the media must be held accountable. Democrats boycotted the hearing and criticized Republicans for “arm chair diagnosing” Biden when the committee could be looking into serious matters.\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, who co-chaired the hearing, said that they will aim to “shine a light on exactly what went on in the White House during Biden's presidency.”\n“We simply cannot ignore what transpired because President Biden is no longer in office,” Cornyn said.\nA spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on the hearing.\nIt was the first in what could be several hearings about Biden in the coming months. Over in the House, the Oversight Committee has subpoenaed several of Biden’s former staff members, along with his White House doctor, ordering him to testify at a June 27 hearing “as part of the investigation into the cover-up of President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline.”\nQuestions about Biden’s age and fitness erupted last summer after his disastrous performance in a debate against Donald Trump, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.\nEven after Trump won back the presidency in November, Republicans have continued to hammer on Biden's age, citing in part new reporting about Biden that was published this year.\nTrump now alleges that Biden administration officials may have forged the former president’s signature and taken sweeping actions without his knowledge, though he provided no evidence of that happening. But Trump has ordered lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department to investigate.\nRepublicans played clips during the hearing Wednesday of Democrats defending Biden. In the montage, the Democrats talk about how Biden was mentally sharp when he was in office.\n“Most Democrats on this committee have chosen to all but boycott the hearing and have failed to call a single witness,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. “They have chosen to ignore this issue, like they ignored President Biden's decline.”\nSen. Dick Durbin, the committee’s top Democrat, criticized Republicans for holding a hearing on the last president at a time when “numerous critical challenges facing the nation that are under our jurisdiction.”\n“Apparently arm chair diagnosing former President Biden is more important than the issues of grave concern,” said Durbin of Illinois.\nAfter his opening remarks, Durbin played a video montage of his own — but with clips of Trump speaking that he said reflected the “cognitive ability” of the current president. Durbin left the hearing after his opening remarks.\nThree witnesses testified: former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, former White House official Theodore Wold and University of Virginia law professor John Harrison. Spicer and Wold both served under Trump.\nMuch of the focus was on Biden's alleged use of an autopen. Trump has repeated long-standing allegations that the Biden White House relied on an autopen to sign presidential pardons, executive orders and other key documents, claiming that its use cast doubt on their validity.\nGOP Sen. Katie Britt also questioned Spicer on “what mechanisms should we put in place” to hold the media accountable “for not actually following what is clearly in front of them.”\n___",
            "Democrats are ‘stuck in that unfortunate reality’ in debate over Biden's illness. Democrats are ‘stuck in that unfortunate reality’ in debate over Biden’s illness\nThe former president’s reemergence after departing the White House hasn’t gone as planned.\nTwenty-four hours after the Sunday announcement that former President Joe Biden has an aggressive form of prostate cancer, one of his staunchest supporters, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said Monday he had yet to connect with him. Another close Hill ally, Sen. Chris Coons, had not spoken with his fellow Delawarean as of midafternoon Tuesday.\nBiden’s longtime friend Bob Brady, the former House member from Pennsylvania who has known Biden for decades, said as of Tuesday afternoon that he hadn’t talked with the former president directly since his cancer diagnosis, though he did touch base Monday with his family. All three said they planned to speak with him soon.\nBefore his cancer diagnosis, Biden had been taking the train from Delaware to Washington, meeting with his post-presidential staff, allies and former Cabinet secretaries, according to a Biden aide granted anonymity to speak freely. In New York City for his appearance on “The View,” he met with former President Bill Clinton. And last week he met with Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a rising star in the party.\nBut Biden, an inveterate creature of Washington who for most of his career seemed to gain life from glad-handing and working a room, hasn’t yet talked to some longtime allies on Capitol Hill in the wake of his diagnosis. Months removed from his presidency, Biden has receded as a fixture of official Washington and has instead become a focal point of his party’s recriminations — his planned reemergence after departing the White House running headlong into a devastating health diagnosis and an unsettled party growing increasingly anxious in the wilderness.\nSome Democrats said they are drafting notes or plan to speak with him. Coons said he was working on finding a time to connect with Biden. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said she has reached out to people ”very close” to the family “and just shared my love, my prayers.” Politicians on both sides of the aisle wished him well.\nMost Democrats are trying, yet again, to pivot from Biden’s health to stay on message as the GOP advances President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda.\nRep. Gabe Amo of Rhode Island, the only former Biden White House aide who now serves in Congress, faulted Biden’s critics for capitalizing on what he called the “politics of the moment.”\n“It’s in their interest to talk about this rather than the issues of the day, so we’re stuck in that unfortunate reality,” Amo said. “I hope that people are focused on one, a legacy of public service, and two, wishing him well in his recovery.”\nOr as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, a Biden reelection co-chair, put it, “We are living through a historic, terrifying backsliding of our democracy … I am so profoundly uninterested in talking about this issue.”\nNot everyone wants to change the subject. Some Democrats, perhaps feeling burned by how Biden’s decline was kept out of public view, are asking pointed questions about his cancer diagnosis — both publicly and privately.\nOn Monday, Ezekiel Emanuel, the oncologist and Biden’s former pandemic adviser, opened the door on MSNBC’s Biden-friendly “Morning Joe” to a round of questions about Biden’s health when he said that Biden “did not develop [cancer] in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021.”\nAt best for Democrats, his remarks scanned to some observers as concern about the care the president received while in office. At worst, they fueled more accusations of a White House cover-up.\nIn a Monday interview, Emanuel said he could not rule out the possibility that Biden had been diagnosed earlier but that information somehow wasn’t released.\n“Look, I’m not his doctor,” Emanuel said. “I can’t rule out that possibility because I don’t know what transpired there.”\nA spokesperson for Biden said Tuesday the former president’s “last known” prostate-specific antigen cancer screening test was in 2014 and that “prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer.”\nThis isn’t the first time Biden has faced health challenges. When he was running for vice president in 2008, Biden disclosed that he had an enlarged prostate and a biopsy but that no evidence of cancer was found. His medical records also showed he had undergone prostate-specific antigen tests, which yielded normal results.\nMore than a decade later, when he was campaigning for the White House in 2019, Biden revealed he had been treated for his enlarged prostate, first with medication and later with surgery. The files stated he “never had prostate cancer.”\nTrump seized on questions surrounding the timeline of diagnosis — something that had quickly become an obsession of Biden’s right-wing detractors online — telling reporters he was “surprised that it wasn’t, you know, the public wasn’t notified a long time ago because to get to stage 9, that’s a long time.” (Biden’s diagnosis is stage-four prostate cancer.) Vice President JD Vance said he blamed the “people around” Biden.\nAsked about new allegations of a conspiracy to keep Biden’s illness secret, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of Republicans advancing the idea, “What a soulless bunch. Anybody who’s spending time doing that, I’ll pray for him in mass this Sunday.”\nTo some allies of Biden, who relied on a small and, critics said, insular circle of advisers during his presidency, even acknowledging such questions is fraught.\n“This just feeds into the conspiracy theories. You have an electorate who doesn’t pay attention, and this is breaking through,” said Democratic strategist Kellan White, who worked as a senior adviser to Biden’s campaign in Pennsylvania in 2024. “All a Gen Z voter who barely pays attention is hearing is, ‘They weekend-at-Bernie-ed Joe Biden who now has cancer, which he probably had for 10 years.’”\nRep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who’s long been close to the Bidens, said in a brief interview she’d sent a message to the former president through his team and “and expressed that I was praying for him and reiterated that he’s in the hearts of every Delawarean right now.”\nShe said she’d spoken to him last at a St. Patrick’s Day event in Wilmington and “he seemed in good spirits. He seemed healthy.”\nBiden’s diagnosis came just as some of the Democratic Party’s brightest stars had begun to grapple with questions about ramifications of his decision to run for reelection — and the fallout for the party.\n“The historians will have to sort out the politics of the whole thing,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who weathered his own cancer diagnosis, said in an interview.\nHe added that he had not spoken to Biden but was drafting him a note. He said, “But at this point, there’s nothing to do, but for those of us who love the guy, to express our solidarity and our sympathy.”",
            "GOP says Dems admit ‘guilt’ in Biden health cover-up by boycotting Senate hearing on ‘constitutional scandal’. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee admonished Democratic colleagues for boycotting and walking out of a Wednesday morning hearing examining former President Joe Biden's health decline while he was in the Oval Office.\n\"I will note that few of my Democratic colleagues are here today,\" Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn said Wednesday. \"Thank you to Sen. Welch from Vermont for being here, leaving us with no other option than to take the boycott of this hearing as an admission of guilt for their role in this crisis.\n\"We must not turn away from the search for answers, and it is not an overstatement to say that the future of our country could one day hinge on how we choose to act or not act on this very issue,\" Cornyn continued.\nThe Senate committee held a hearing Wednesday morning dubbed, \"Unfit to Serve: How the Biden Cover-up Endangered America and Undermined the Constitution.\"\nSENATE HEARING ON WHO WAS 'REALLY RUNNING' BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KICKS OFF WEDNESDAY\nVermont Democrat Sen. Peter Welch and Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin did attend the start of the hearing, with Durbin abruptly walking out after describing the hearing as a distraction and accusing Republican colleagues of being \"asleep at the wheel\" with other legal issues within the Trump administration due to their focus on Biden.\n\"In the last week alone, several events have demanded this committee's immediate attention,\" Durbin said Wednesday. \"The horrific assassination in Minnesota, the treatment of our colleague Sen. Padilla by federal agents in Los Angeles, and President Trump's unprecedented deployment of the U.S. military in Los Angeles.\n\"We should hear without delay from Attorney General Bondi and FBI Director Patel about what they are doing to address the unacceptable political violence in our country, including threats to Article III judges and justices, as well as members of Congress,\" Durbin said. \"And we need to hear from the Homeland Security Secretary Noem about the treatment of our colleague, Sen. Padilla, and this administration's mass deportation campaign against immigrants.\"\nWelch also left the hearing after declaring it would not benefit his constituents.\nEX-WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TO TESTIFY ON WHO 'REALLY RAN THE COUNTRY' DURING BIDEN ERA\nThere are 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including lawmakers such as Sens. Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Adam Schiff of California. The press secretary for Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats directed Fox Digital to Durbin's initial participation in the hearing and his remarks when asked about GOP lawmakers arguing Democrats' boycott of the hearing was an admission of guilt.\nRepublican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seethed that Democrats and the media \"lied\" and covered up Biden's health decline, while slamming Democrats for their lack of participation.\n\"Not a single Democrat is here today because not a single one of them gives a d--- about the fact that they lied to the American people for four years,\" Cruz said at the hearing. \"They knew. Every one of them knew that Joe Biden was mentally not competent to do the job. The White House press secretary, she knew, when she stood in front of the American people and lied over and over and over again. And they're not here because they can't defend themselves. It wasn't a surprise, for four years, the White House hid President Biden from Republican senators. Would not let him meet with us.\"\nOther Republicans railed against Democratic counterparts for skipping the hearing, such as Missouri Republican Sen. Eric Schmidt.\n\"Today, as we seek to answer this question, it is deeply disappointing, but not surprising, that most Democrats on this committee have chosen all but boycott the hearing and failed to call a single witness,\" Schmidt said at the hearing. \"They have chosen to ignore this issue like they ignored President Biden's decline. Their absence speaks volumes, an implicit admission that the truth is too inconvenient to face. By refusing to engage in this critical examination, they abdicate their responsibility to the American people. This de facto boycott is not just a refusal to participate. It's a refusal to serve the American people who deserve answers about who was truly leading their government.\n\"The title of the hearing, ‘Unfit to Serve,’ captures a sobering and undeniable truth,\" Schmidt added. \"President Biden was mentally unfit to carry out the responsibilities of the most powerful office in the world. Given his mental incapacity, the American people deserve to know who was running the country the last four years.\"\nSENATE REPUBLICANS PLAN HEARING ON BIDEN'S ALLEGED COGNITIVE DECLINE COVER-UP\nThe hearing included testimony from three experts, including University of Virginia law professor John Harrison, conservative think tank Heritage Foundation fellow Theodore Wold, and a former White House press secretary from the first Trump administration, Sean Spicer.\nConcern over Biden's mental acuity hit a fever pitch in 2024 as the election cycle heated up, when the then-president delivered a dismal debate performance against now-President Donald Trump in June. The debate opened the floodgates of criticism, including traditional Democrat allies calling for Biden to drop out of the presidential race after conservatives had already long argued that Biden's mental acuity was slipping and he was unfit to serve as commander in chief.\nConcerns over his health have continued after his presidential tenure ended, including with the revelation that the Biden admin frequently used an autopen to sign official presidential documents, the release of Biden's interview with former Special Counsel Robert Hur, and Biden's shock announcement in May that he had advanced prostate cancer.\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project first investigated the Biden administration's use of an autopen earlier in 2025 and found that the same signature was on a bevvy of executive orders and other official documents, while Biden’s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the apparent machine-produced signature.\nSCOOP: GOP PUSH FOR NEW HOUSE COMMITTEE TO PROBE BIDEN DECLINE 'COVER-UP' GAINS STEAM\nHeritage fellow Wold testified before the committee and described the alleged cover-up of Biden's declining health a \"constitutional crisis.\"\n\"I will say the 25th Amendment. It's a modern contrivance, but it still is consistent with the American Constitution, which assumes that officers of the United States will act virtuously and morally,\" Wold said. \"And the idea that members of the Cabinet would go to the length of avoiding the Oval Office so as to abdicate their responsibility to verify the appropriateness of the president's acuity or the ability to authenticate actions taken by the president. If that's not a constitutional scandal, I honestly, I don't know what would what would constitute such.\n\"There could be the potential for crimes,\" he said. \"But moreover, the 25th Amendment can only function in its sole mechanisms if people are actually willing to call a spade a spade.\"\nBIDEN’S SENILITY SCANDAL LEADS TOP REPUBLICAN TO DEMAND DOJ PROBE INTO ‘REPRESENTATIONS’ TO PUBLIC\nThe U.S. Constitution’s 25th Amendment states that \"whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBiden's Cabinet, other administration officials and Democrat lawmakers fiercely defended his health amid outcry from Republicans and others that Biden's health had cratered and that he was likely unfit to serve as president."

            "Trump threatens to keep 25% tariff on UK steel imports over Port Talbot concerns. Donald Trump is threatening to keep 25% tariffs on some or all of its steel imports from the UK unless it gives specific guarantees over the Indian-owned steelmaking plant at Port Talbot in south Wales, sources have told the Guardian.\nAn agreement to reduce tariffs on UK car exports to the US and scrap them for the aerospace sector was signed off by the US president and Keir Starmer on Monday, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada.\nHowever, it did not include the removal of tariffs on steel imports from the UK. Officials are still negotiating over the fine points of a deal to cover the steel and aluminium industry, amid US concerns about the fact that Tata Steel imports raw materials from abroad.\nStarmer told reporters in Banff, Canada: “There’s further work to do in relation to steel, but we’re getting on and doing that work.”\nTrump and Starmer announced the main terms of the trade agreement in May, with the UK prime minister calling it a “fantastic, historic day”. According to that deal, tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars are due to be reduced to 10% from 27.5%.\nAs it stands, UK steelmakers still face 25% tariffs, although this is lower than the global tariff of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on other nations. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed” in May.\nThe deal was heralded by Downing Street as a triumph for Starmer’s brand of gentle diplomacy, in which he wooed the president with the promise of a state visit while shying away from any direct criticism on topics such as trade.\nThe May trade announcement itself was followed by weeks of further talks as the two sides continued to negotiate over the small print. Monday’s announcement by the two leaders means the tariff reductions will kick in for aerospace and automobiles over the coming weeks, with Starmer saying they would begin “very soon”.\nHowever, the Trump administration is understood to be seeking further guarantees on British steel exports, given Tata Steel has closed its blast furnaces at Port Talbot last year and therefore now imports raw materials from abroad until the planned opening of a new, much cleaner electric arc furnace in 2027.\nAccording to US import rules, steel must be “melted and poured” in a country to qualify as having originated in that country.\nThe company says these supplies come from Tata’s other sites, mainly those in the Netherlands and India.\nUS trade officials are considering granting Tata an exemption, sources say, but are asking for guarantees about when it will switch on its new electric arc furnaces, and therefore stop importing raw materials from abroad. They also want to know where those supplies are coming from and how Tata is able to track their movements throughout the supply chain.\nThe British government is hoping that the fact that Tata does not import any of the raw steel from China will persuade the Trump administration to include all British exports in the deal.\nStarmer is sending his business adviser Varun Chandra to lead a delegation to Washington next week, and officials say they are confident of striking a final deal next month.\nThe Chinese ownership of British Steel, which has a separate plant at Scunthorpe, is understood not to be an issue since the government took over its management.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of the steel industry union Community, said on Tuesday: “It is now absolutely vital that a deal for steel is secured as soon as possible. Our steel producers and their US customers need an end to the current state of uncertainty to allow normal business to resume.\n“Crucially, we must see a full exemption for all UK steel exports to the US – without that guarantee, some of our leading steel businesses could be left behind, with a threat to jobs and livelihoods.”\nA government source said: “Thanks to our agreement with the US, the UK is the only country in the world to be exempt from the 50% tariff on steel and aluminium that other countries now face.\n“Yesterday the US president confirmed his intention to work with the UK to remove the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, helping us to ensure they can be implemented as soon as possible and in the best interests of the UK industry.”\nAdditional reporting by Peter Walker in Banff",
            "‘Vital’ that British steel gets Trump tariff deal after UK-US trade pact, say unions. Steel trade unions have said it is “absolutely vital” that the UK rapidly secures a deal to protect the sector from Donald Trump’s tariffs, after the industry was excluded from an initial UK-US pact signed on Monday night.\nKeir Starmer and Trump signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with the US president saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs “because I like them”.\nThe car industry was relieved that tariffs on the sector will be reduced to 10% from 27.5%. The UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US after deal, which followed an initial agreement made in May.\nHowever, the announcement of the deal did not include the removal of tariffs on steel imports. UK steelmakers still face 25% tariffs, although this is lower than the global tariff of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on other nations.\nThe UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed”.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of the steel union Community, welcomed the progress that has been made on reaching a deal on steel.\n“However, it’s now absolutely vital that a deal for steel is secured as soon as possible,” he said. “Our steel producers and their US customers need an end to the current state of uncertainty to allow normal business to resume.\n“Crucially, we must see a full exemption for all UK steel exports to the US – without that guarantee some of our leading steel businesses could be left behind, with a threat to jobs and livelihoods.”\nA steel industry source said the automotive deal had been widely expected to be completed before steel and aluminium. However, the person said “we now need steel to happen pretty quickly” to avoid the risk of 50% tariffs kicking in on 9 July, under the terms of the UK’s temporary exemption.\nGareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said: “We look forward to imminently benefiting from a tariff rate cut similar to that which the automotive and aerospace industries will enjoy in seven days. The UK steel industry badly needs clarification over the ‘melted and poured’ requirement, and the level of quotas available to UK steelmakers so that we can restore the historical trade routes that have served both the UK and the US economies for many years.”\nMinisters have been working to ensure the UK’s biggest steelmaker, Tata Steel, is included in tariff-free access to the US. Its bosses fear the deal could end up excluding Indian-owned Tata Steel, which runs the vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, because of the origin of some of its products. The company exports more than $100m (£74m) worth of goods to the US every year.\nThe Chinese ownership of British Steel, which is under government control, could be a sticking point in a deal for the industry as the executive order signed by Trump suggests the US wants assurances that the metal originates in the UK.\n“The UK also committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products intended for export to the US and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities,” the order states.\nSeparately, British Steel has secured a new five-year supply contract with Network Rail worth more than £500m, under which British Steel will supply between 70,000 and 80,000 tonnes of rail a year. McDiarmid welcomed the extension but expressed concern that “British Steel’s share of the Network Rail contract is set to reduce significantly”.\nMike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he hoped the new 10% tariff rate for UK carmakers would start “in the next few days”.\nThe UK-US trade pact had been negotiated in early May, “but we’ve been waiting for it to be implemented so manufacturers can start shipping without being subject to those punitive tariffs”, he said.\nHe added that “a lot less” had been exported to the US in the meantime, and some UK manufacturers had halted shipments. The British luxury carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Bentley are among those that paused shipments.\n“They’ve been pausing because their customers – we’ve got shrewd customers – were going to wait and see what was going to happen,” Hawes said. “You could see that the cost to the ultimate consumer was going to come down because of the reduction in the tariff, but you just didn’t know when.”",
            "Trump says UK is protected from tariffs ‘because I like them’ as trade deal is signed off. Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with the US president saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs “because I like them”.\nThe two leaders presented the deal, which covers aerospace and the auto sector, at the G7 venue in Kananaskis, Alberta.\nWhen reporters asked about steel, Trump said: “We’re going to let you have that information in a little while.”\nUnder details released by the Department for Business and Trade, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US, while the auto industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%.\nThe steel industry still faces 25% tariffs for now, although this is less than the US’s global rate of 50% on steel and aluminium. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to “make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed”.\nHowever, the US executive order implementing the deal highlighted a possible hiccup over steel tariffs. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel.\nIn a paragraph setting out a future move to “most-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles”, the order says the UK has “committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities”.\nThis would seem to refer to US worries about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel even though the UK government took control of the company in April to stop Jingye closing its Scunthorpe plant. Trump’s administration wants assurances that Jingye does not use British Steel as a way to circumvent US tariffs.\nA full version of the deal first outlined in May had been seen as imminent, but Downing Street will be particularly happy to have it finalised at the summit, with full endorsement from a cheerful Trump – even if he did wrongly say the deal was with the EU.\n“I just signed it, and it’s done. And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union, and it’s a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income,” Trump said.\n“And we have many, many other ones coming. But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good, but the relationship that we have is fantastic.”\nAs has been his habit in recent meetings with Starmer, the mercurial president was warm in his praise for a fellow leader who is not a political soulmate. “We’re very longtime partners and allies and friends, and we’ve become friends in a short period of time. He’s slightly more liberal than I am,” Trump joked at one point.\nAsked if the UK was now protected from future tariffs, Trump said: “The UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them – that’s their ultimate protection.”\nHe added: “The prime minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He’s done a very, very good job. He’s done what other people, they’ve been talking about this deal for six years, and he’s done what they haven’t been able to do. So he’s done really a very good job.”\nThe comments came just before the pair met for talks at the G7 event, where Starmer was poised to push the US president for new sanctions against Russia and to help end the war between Iran and Israel.\nIn a separate announcement late on Monday, Downing Street said it expected further sanctions on Moscow to be set out at the summit, seeking to “ratchet up pressure until Russia is ready to commit to a full and unconditional ceasefire”. No 10 said there would be more details on Tuesday.",
            "UK steel firms on edge as talks to cut Trump tariffs near deadline. British steelmakers face a nervous wait to discover if they will be hit by US tariffs, after the UK government said it was trying to complete a deal to protect the industry from Donald Trump’s trade war.\nThe US has set a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminium imports. While the UK has brokered a reduced rate of 25% and is trying to bring it down to zero, a deal has not yet been completed.\nOn Monday, Downing Street refused to confirm it was confident it could eliminate US tariffs on UK steel before Trump’s deadline on 9 July.\nA spokesperson for No 10 said: “Our work with the US continues to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.\n“That will remove the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminium, making us the only country in the world to have tariffs removed on these products.\n“The US agreed to remove tariffs on these products as part of our agreement on 8 May. It reiterated that again at the G7 last month. The discussions continue, and will continue to do so.”\nThe Trump administration has said it will send letters to trading partners without a deal by 9 July. On Monday, Trump caused some confusion over whether tariffs would be implemented by the 9 July deadline, before his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said tariff rates would take effect on 1 August.\nWhen asked again whether ministers were confident British producers will not be hit by the original 50% tariff, the Downing Street spokesperson said that “discussions continue”.\n“We have very close engagement with the US, and the US has been clear that it wants to keep talking to us to get the best deal for businesses and consumers on both sides,” they said.\nStarmer and Trump signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada last month. Under the agreement, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US, while the car industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%.\nThe US executive order implementing the deal highlighted the British steel industry, noting the UK “has committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products … and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities”.\nIt likely reflects worries in the US about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel despite the fact that the British government took control of the company in April to stop the closure of its Scunthorpe plant. The Trump administration has sought assurances that China’s Jingye does not use British Steel as a route to circumvent US tariffs.",
            "Shiploads of cars ready to set sail for US from UK as trade deal kicks in. Shiploads of Minis, Aston Martins and Range Rovers will set sail for the US on Monday as the UK-US trade deal kicks in, but British farmers say they have been used as collateral to save the car industry.\nAuto shipments across the Atlantic were down more than half in May after Donald Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on 3 April on top of an existing 2.5% levy.\nHowever, as of one minute past midnight US time on Monday – 5am in the UK – that has been reduced to 10% for cars, and UK manufacturers expect pent-up demand to be unleashed.\nAston Martin’s chief executive, Adrian Hallmark, said the luxury carmaker had stopped shipping between April and June, something he said had been “not catastrophic, but slightly uncomfortable”.\nThe outline of the trade deal was agreed between Trump and Keir Starmer in early May, the first such bilateral pact to mitigate the president’s import taxes. However, delays in agreeing the fine print meant the higher tariff had continued to apply, pushing the cost of British cars up by more than a quarter for US importers.\nHallmark told a British car industry conference last week that he was “planning to invoice three months’ worth of sales in a 24-hour period”, with stocks in the US down by 50% due to the pause.\nAston Martin exports 90% of its cars, but its customers are wealthy and were willing to wait. “The demand has been strong and will be in good shape when we start to invoice cars like fury on Monday next week,” he said.\nOn the eve of the trade deal coming into force, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, received reassurances from the sportscar maker Lotus that it had no plans to close its UK factory, in Hethel, Norfolk.\nReynolds contacted Lotus bosses after it emerged that the carmaker was considering shifting production to the US – a move that would jeopardise 1,300 jobs.\nA Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said Reynolds met Lotus and its owner, Geely, on Sunday to clarify the company’s situation, and “was reassured by management that they are committed to their UK operations and have no plans to close their Hethel plant”.\nA decision to relocate manufacturing abroad by a prestige brand such as Lotus would be embarrassing for the UK government. Labour’s industrial strategy, published last week, singled out automotive production as among the strategic sectors it wants to support.\nThe car industry welcomed the US-UK trade deal when it was struck, with it preventing job losses at JLR, the maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands. Range Rovers are particularly popular in the US.\nHowever, the lower 10% duty only applies to a quota of 100,000 cars a year – slightly below last year’s export numbers – leaving little room for growth. JLR alone exported 84,000 cars in the year up to April 2025.\nThe initial trade deal also included a promise of zero tariffs on steel but this has been held up by negotiations over the origin of some raw materials for smelting, particularly at Tata’s plant at Port Talbot in south Wales.\nConcessions were won with new tariff-free quotas for British and US beef in each other’s markets, as well the controversial removal of a 19% tariff on American ethanol imports, which the UK industry says leaves biofuel plants facing closure.\nThe president of the National Farmers’ Union, Tom Bradshaw, said the government must stop using agriculture as a bargaining chip in talks and urged Starmer to take the sector off the table in the talks on steel and remove the 10% baseline tariff Trump has applied to all imports.\n“Agriculture has borne the responsibility of removing tariffs for other sectors. At some point they’ve got to stop relying on agriculture to take the burden,” Bradshaw said. “Agriculture has nothing left to give.”\nOn the upside for farmers, they can now sell 13,000 tonnes of British beef to the US, but again there is a catch. They will not be able to sell until January next year because beef is part of a wider tariff deal with other countries, and this year’s quota has already been filled by Brazilians who stockpile beef in storage near the Mexican border.\nThe UK steel industry has at least won a temporary exemption from the 50% tariff imposed by Trump at the start of this month until 9 July, but it still faces a 25% tariff on exports. It is waiting anxiously for delivery of the promised zero rate tariff.\n“Time is running out to secure a UK-US steel deal and remove damaging tariffs,” said Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel.\n“Every day of delay costs our steelmakers dearly. Contracts are being lost, investment decisions remain on hold, and uncertainty is paralysing business decisions. We urgently need a swift, positive resolution to these talks to protect jobs, unlock growth, and restore confidence in the sector.”\nYet even in a zero-tariff deal, Port Talbot may still face issues. The UK operations of the Indian conglomerate are relying on imports of steel melted and poured in its sister plants in India and the Netherlands while they move from a polluting blast furnace to the greener electric arc furnace to smelt steel.\nHowever, UK Steel is hoping there can be an exception to the tariffs agreed for the Welsh operation along with the five other plants in the UK. UK trade officials are understood to be optimistic they can secure such an exemption.",
            "UK economy grew despite Trump tariffs causing three-year low in US goods exports – business live. The start of the second quarter – 2 April, to be precise – will go down in economic history after the US revealed its “liberation day” tariffs. That sparked financial market chaos, and huge real-world disruption as exporters to the US tried to work out whether it was possible to continue sending products to the world’s biggest consumer market.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said:\nTariff effects are clearly being felt by companies exporting to the US. Total goods exports across the Atlantic for the second quarter 2025 were 13.5% lower than a year ago. But the UK’s performance is not all bleak, with strong services exports across the second quarter.\nThis was the first full quarter of the ‘reciprocal’ US tariffs, which add an extra 10% to most UK sectors, from food and drink to chemicals. The effect of these higher costs is becoming clear, with the lowest levels of goods exports to the US for three years.\nImplementation of the UK’s trade deal with the US in full is now needed to improve prospects, particularly for steel and aluminium goods. The agreement should be a platform to discuss further tariff reform with the US, especially in goods sectors where there is little competition on production.\nThe increase came despite UK goods exports to the US slumping by 13.5% in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, as the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs became clearer. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was the lowest UK exports to the US in three years, when trade was heavily disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe UK was not the only country to report “hot” data that will give central banks pause before cutting interest rates. In the US producer price index inflation surged in July, up 0.9% in the month, and 3.3% higher than a year earlier, according to data published on Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTraders pulled back on bets of a bigger cut than usual – of half a percentage point – at the Federal Reserve’s next meeting in September. Reuters reported:\nThe dollar index gained 0.2% from an over two-week low […] while benchmark 10-year yields edged up from a one-week low.\nStronger US wholesale price data tempered bets on a larger, half-point cut next month. Traders are now leaning toward a quarter-point move with another in October, reinforcing comments from Fed’s Mary Daly that such a large cut is not needed.\nHow much should the Federal Reserve be worried that wholesale price rises mean the US is in for a bout of inflation heat?\n“Price pressures are building, but July’s data overstate the intensity”, said Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. The Fed looks particularly carefully at the core personal consumption expenditure index as a key measure of inflationary pressure in the US economy. Not all of the producer price index inflation will feed through, Tombs said.\nIn a note to clients, he wrote:\nThe surge in producer prices has limited implications for the July core PCE deflator, but indicates that the new tariffs are continuing to generate cost pressures in the supply chain, which consumers will shoulder soon.\nThe outlook remains for a steady climb in core PCE inflation towards a peak of about 3.25% at the end of this year, despite the surge in producer prices.\nThe producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.9% in July, according to the under-pressure Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That was far above the 0.2% expected by economists polled by Reuters.\nThe reading will ring alarm bells for economists watching for signs of inflationary pressure in the US economy. The Fed has cited inflationary concerns as a reason to leave interest rates on hold.\nTariffs are expected to raise costs for businesses importing materials to produce products within the US. That is expected to pass through to the broader economy.\nAlthough Trump is perhaps unlikely to engage with the details of inflation, the data comes at a sensitive time for the BLS. Trump fired its head, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report which he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged”.\nHowever, early monthly payroll data from HM Revenue and Customs appears to indicate that the number of non-dom departures is in line with official predictions, according to sources cited by the Financial Times.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast in January that 25% of non-doms with trusts would leave the UK in response to the abolition of the tax status, while 10% of those without trusts would leave. Official data suggests this prediction was broadly correct, people briefed on the findings told the FT.\nBlanc told journalists that the insurer was not wavering on climate transition plans, which she said were an important step in responding to a further rise in extreme weather events affecting its insurance business. She said on Thursday:\nWe remain committed to our ambition. It’s also an important priority for many of our clients, but I would always put this into the context of extreme weather conditions, climate change and the impact that that has on our insurance business that actually insures properties.\nThe joint statement is not legally binding and has been described by the EU as a “road map” for future negotiations on potential reductions of tariffs on sectors such as steel, wines and spirits and some agriculture products. EU spokesperson Olof Gill said:\nWe have received a text from the US with their suggestions for getting closer to that finalisation of the document.\nWe are going to make our suggestions back, we will ping pong it forward and back until we get to a final text and I hope we can get there soon.\nThe EU struck a deal with the US which will see 15% tariffs on imports from the bloc but – unlike other countries including the UK – these tariffs, uniquely, will not be “stacked” on top of existing tariffs.\nAn average tariff of 4.8% applied to EU imports before Trump came into power with a 3.7% applying in the UK. The latest deals mean on average the UK and EU tariffs are not so far apart, at 15% and 13.7% on average.\nHowever, the EU is still hit by punitive steel tariffs, currently at 50% compared to the UK where the older 25% tariff applies.\nThe start of the second quarter – 2 April, to be precise – will go down in economic history after the US revealed its “liberation day” tariffs. That sparked financial market chaos, and huge real-world disruption as exporters to the US tried to work out whether it was possible to continue sending products to the world’s biggest consumer market.\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said:\nTariff effects are clearly being felt by companies exporting to the US.

Group profit increased 69% to a record £521m. We have an additional one million customers across our diversified businesses compared to this time last year, due to our focus on offering competitively priced cover and excellent service across our diversified businesses.\nData spotted by Bloomberg showed that positions likely to indicate short sellers were at the highest since the financial crisis. It reported:\nGreggs stock out on loan — an indication of short interest — reached 9% of shares outstanding as of Tuesday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. That’s the highest since March 2008, with the bulk of this year’s activity occurring in the past four months.\nShort sellers borrow shares from other companies (for a small fee). They then sell those shares, and hope that the price falls before they buy them back. If the price has fallen then they pocket the difference – although if the price rises then there is no actual limit on their losses.\nBut short sellers think that it will struggle after rapid expansion. From last month’s Guardian report:\nGreggs, which operates 2,649 shops across the UK, notched up more than £1bn in sales in the first six months of the year for the first time, but its profits fell as it battled rising costs, lower footfall and more weather disruption than in 2024.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority’s data showed that JP Morgan Asset Management held the biggest short position, equivalent to 1% of Greggs’s shares. BlackRock Investment Management, ExodusPoint and GLG were the other asset managers with positions worth more than 0.5% of the company that they had to disclose.\nThe size of the boom in artificial intelligence spending is fairly astonishing: the Financial Times reported that Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will spend more than $400bn on capital expenditure in 2026 — on top of more than $350bn this year. That compares with less than $100bn (still a staggering sum) in 2020.\nAnd the old adage about shovel makers in a gold rush appears to be playing out. Taiwan’s Foxconn is famous for making the Apple iPhone, but work making servers for chip designer Nvidia has surpassed that, the company said on Thursday.\nReuters reported:\nFoxconn expects higher third-quarter revenue, it said on Thursday, on robust demand for artificial intelligence servers, which helped the world’s largest contract electronics maker report a forecast-beating 27% increase in second-quarter profit.\nThose servers are then sold by Nvidia to the companies racing to win the artificial intelligence battle by investing in the most computing power. The big tech companies hope that more “compute” will allow them to dominate the sector (although they could be left holding the world’s most expensive bag if cheaper models come along and match their performance).\nEurope’s economy is showing “fading industrial resilience and stark divergence across the eurozone”, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, an investment bank.\nHe wrote in a note to clients:\nIndustrial production plunged by 1.3% month-on-month in June, from +1.1% in May. On the year, eurozone industrial production was only marginally up. With today’s data, the strong surge in the first quarter due to the US front-loading of eurozone goods ahead of higher tariffs has basically been reversed entirely.\nWhile tariffs and the stronger euro will continue to weigh on the manufacturing sector, the gradual cyclical turning of the inventory cycle as well as the structural shift towards defence should support growth ahead.\nEurozone GDP’s second reading came in as expected at 0.1% quarter-on-quarter for the second quarter – weak, but not a surprise. However, there were some worrying signs from industrial production data.\nIndustrial production fell by 1.3% in the eurozone in the year to June, according to figures published by Eurostat. That was an acceleration in the rate of decline from May, and worse than the 1% drop expected by economists polled by Reuters.\nCompanies raced to produce goods and ship them to the US in the first quarter of 2025 – providing a short-lived boost to economic output – but that looks to have unwound during the second quarter, as the tariffs were actually implemented. European factory output has since fallen back.\nHowever, Matt Swannell, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, a forecaster, said that “the underlying picture for the UK is one of continued sluggish growth”.\nHe said:\nThis largely reflects the strength of domestic headwinds, including a significant tightening in fiscal policy and the lagged impact of past interest rate rises. US tariff announcements will also drag on the near-term growth outlook."

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nMore American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\nThe study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.\nWhen I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.\n– Dr. Marie Crandall MetroHealth medical center chief of surgery, Cleveland\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”\nBut she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.\n“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\nBut Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.\n“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.\nAfter her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime.

There was no immediate information on the motive of the 21-year-old man, who had no previous police record. He used two weapons, which he was believed to have owned legally, police said. READ MORE: Suspect in fatal stabbing in Austria had possible Islamic State connection, officials say “Today is a dark day in the history of our country,” Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker told reporters in Graz, a city of about 300,000 people in southeastern Austria. He called it “a national tragedy that shocks us deeply” and said there would be three days of national mourning, with the Austrian flag lowered to half-staff at official buildings. A national minute of silence is to be held on Wednesday morning in memory of the victims. Special forces were among those sent to the BORG Dreierschützengasse high school, about a kilometer (over half a mile) from Graz’s historic center, after calls at 10 a.m. reporting shots the building. More than 300 police officers were sent to the school, which was evacuated. Footage from the scene showed students filing out quickly past armed officers. Police said security was restored in 17 minutes. The assailant, who acted alone, was a 21-year-old Austrian man who lived near Graz, police said. His name wasn’t released. Regional police chief Gerald Ortner said two firearms — a long gun and a handgun — were used in the shooting and recovered from the scene, and that the assailant was apparently legally in possession of them. The man took his own life in a bathroom. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said the gunman had been a student at the school and hadn’t completed his studies. He didn’t specify when the man left the school or at what age. Karner said six of the dead were female and three male, but didn’t give further information. Austria’s Red Cross said it had deployed 65 ambulances to the scene and 158 emergency staffers were helping treat the injured. In addition, 40 specially trained psychologists were counseling students and parents. The Red Cross also called on locals to come forward and donate blood. Metin Özden was in his kebab restaurant near the school when he first heard police cars sped by, and then a police helicopter above. He told the Krone newspaper: “I knew something bad had happened. … I’ve never seen so many emergency services in my entire life.” He also described to the paper seeing parents walking past his restaurant and crying on the way to the school. Tuesday’s violence appeared to be the deadliest attack in Austria’s post-World War II history. In 2020, four people were killed in Vienna and the suspect, a sympathizer of the Islamic State group, also died, in a shooting. More than 20 other people, including a police officer, were wounded. In June 2015, a man killed three people and injured more than 30 when he drove through a crowd in downtown Graz with an SUV.

            "Austrian school shooter planned attack in detail but motive unclear, police say. Austrian school shooter planned attack in detail but motive unclear, police say\nOfficials say the former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail\nGRAZ, Austria -- The former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail, but he appears to have shot his victims at random and investigators still haven't been able to ascertain his motive, officials said Thursday.\nThe 21-year-old had left the BORG Dreierschützengasse high school in Graz three years ago, breaking off his studies after attending for three years, police said. They said they knew of no personal connection between the gunman and the students he shot, but that one of the two teachers he shot had once taught him. They were still investigating whether that was a factor.\nThe attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.\nThe assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.\nHe opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.\nA search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to “an apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,” but offered no “indication for a motive.”\nThey also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack “down to the smallest detail\" — setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.\nLohnegger said a picture had emerged of “a very introverted person” who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.\n“But even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,” he added. The man had no previous police record and “there were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.”\nThe shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.\nHe had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.\nStarting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.\nThe slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report."

            "Gavin Newsom locks horns with Trump in a politically defining moment. Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.\nThe battle between the president and the governor of the country’s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump’s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts — in part through his new podcast — to cast himself in the role of conciliator.\nNewsom delivered an address Tuesday night that aimed squarely at Trump and was clearly intended for a national audience.\n\"This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commander the National Guard, he made that order apply to every state in this nation. This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.\"\n“For someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “This is unprecedented. There’s not a right answer. So far, he’s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.”\nNewsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.\n“The images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,\" he said.\n“Trump always goes too far,” Bennett added. “Last time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation — those images really hurt Trump. Here, it’s a real question. It’s a much closer call this time. We just don’t know yet.”\nAs it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \"Newscum\") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions — which have included deploying the U.S. Marines — as an overreach.\nThe White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. They included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.\nOn Monday, California sued Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.\nNewsom has slammed the step as escalatory and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions” and that there was “currently no unmet need.”\nNewsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.\n\"You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are — being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom said on X.\nOn Sunday, Newsom chided Trump \"border czar\" Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: \"Tom, arrest me. Let’s go.\"\nLate Monday, Newsom sat for a \"Pod Save America\" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and said some of those assigned to Los Angeles — in his view, unnecessarily — were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for \"this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.\"\nBy Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn’t pardon 1500 of them?\"\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.\nThe White House had a different take.\n“The President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,\" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.”\nAt that, Newsom responded on X: \"Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.\"\nSince November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lie low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He has also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.\nTrump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.\nNow, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom — at least for the moment — and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.\nFriends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.\nThat would be \"a Nelson Mandela moment\" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\nAt the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.\n\"He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,\" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. \"I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.\"\nAnother observer had a different take: “This whole fiasco could make Gavin president,” Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump’s first term, wrote Monday on X.\nThe obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.\n\"The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Good governance is always the best politics — to just show competence contrasting with Trump’s chaos.\"\nTrump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.\nThe relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters \"insurrectionists,\" declared the demonstrations a \"rebellion.\"\nThe California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.\nThe powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state — as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.\nDemocrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops — especially without the consent of the governor.\n\"Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,\" McAuliffe said. \"This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.\"\nBennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.\n“This is a very, very dangerous thing,\" Bennett said. \"God forbid, if they hurt somebody … that’s real trouble for Trump. But [we’re] not rooting for that.”",
            "Standoff with troops in Los Angeles reignites old feud as Newsom resists Trump's immigration raids. Standoff with troops in Los Angeles reignites old feud as Newsom resists Trump's immigration raids\nAn escalating clash pits a Republican president looking to fulfill his mass deportation goals against a Democratic governor with White House aspirations hoping to mobilize opposition\nWASHINGTON -- It was earlier this year that California Gov. Gavin Newsom was making nice with President Donald Trump as he sought help for his wildfire-battered state and moderating his approach ahead of a potential bid for the White House.\nBut now the gloves are off after Trump took the extraordinary step of federalizing the National Guard in Los Angeles over Newsom’s objections and the governor responded by suing the administration, alleging abuse of power that marked an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”\nThe escalating clash pits the leader of the Republican Party against a Democrat with ambitions of leading his own party, with a striking backdrop of a domestic troop deployment meant to control a city in unrest and now to assist in arresting migrants — the centerpiece of the president’s agenda.\nFor Trump, it’s another chance to battle with Newsom, a frequent foil who leads a heavily Democratic state the president has long criticized. And for Newsom, the feud has handed him a national platform as a beleaguered Democratic Party seeks a leader able to resist Trump.\n“He has shown he’s not going to be intimidated, and we’re all for that,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of Newsom on Wednesday.\nConservative commentator Ben Shapiro, a former California resident, said Newsom's motivations for taking on Trump are clear.\n“This is all about Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, and what he is hoping is that becoming the face of a resistance to Trump is going to jog him to victory in Democratic primaries,” he said in his podcast “The Ben Shapiro Show.”\nTrump has long been a foe of California, which overwhelmingly rejected him in all three of his presidential campaigns.\nOver the years, Trump has threatened to intercede in the state's long-running homeless crisis, vowed to withhold federal wildfire aid as political leverage in a dispute over water rights, called on police to shoot people robbing stores and warned residents “your children are in danger” because of illegal immigration.\nAs a candidate in 2023, Trump said California was once a symbol of American prosperity but is “becoming a symbol of our nation’s decline.”\n“This is not a great state anymore. This is a dumping ground,” Trump said at the time. “The world is being dumped into California. Prisoners. Terrorists. Mental patients.”\nNewsom would learn to balance the dueling imperatives of a governor who needs to work with the federal government with being one of the Democratic Party's most prominent figures.\nAs governor-elect, Newsom joined Trump in November 2018 as the then-president viewed wildfire damage in Paradise, California, and they pledged to put aside political differences to help the community recover. He was also overly complimentary of the Trump administration's assistance to California during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, praising Trump's “focus on treatments” for the virus and thanking him for sending masks and gloves to his state.\nBut Newsom was also a top surrogate for Democrats in the 2024 campaign and frequently warned of the consequences of Trump's return to the White House.\nThere was a handshake and a warm pat on the back.\nNewsom was there on the tarmac in Los Angeles in January, welcoming Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who had traveled west to survey the damage from the deadly wildfires in Southern California.\nThen they spoke to reporters together, pledging cooperation to rebuild the area and appreciating each other's presence.\n“You were there for us during COVID. I don’t forget that,” Newsom said. “And I have all the expectations that we’ll be able to work together to get this speedy recovery.”\nTrump added: “We will. We’re going to get it done.”\nNewsom also traveled to Washington in February to press Trump and lawmakers for more federal wildfire relief. The governor called his meeting with Trump “productive” and one that was marked with a “spirit of collaboration and cooperation.”\nThe cordial attitude was part of Newsom’s unmistakable appeal to the center, painting himself as a pragmatist to reach out to those who had fled from a party that had just lost all battleground states in the 2024 presidential election.\nNewsom spoke to conservative allies of Trump on a new podcast the governor billed as a way for Democrats to learn from the political successes of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. He voiced opposition to transgender athletes participating in female sports while shifting focus away from efforts in Sacramento to “Trump-proof” California — which Newsom embarked on after Trump’s victory in November — as the wildfires raged.\nIn an April interview with YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, Newsom acknowledged Trump’s ability to appeal to the public.\n“His success is his ability to win every damn news cycle and get us distracted and moving in 25 different directions,” he said.\nThe Democratic governor and Trump have been feuding publicly about the response to protests, with Newsom claiming Trump didn't warn him he'd deploy troops in a Friday phone call and Trump claiming the conversation was about that.\nNewsom has taunted Trump administration officials with arresting him, and Trump first appeared receptive to the idea and then walked back earlier remarks.\nAfter Newsom filed an emergency request in federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles, he gave a public address accusing Trump of going beyond arresting criminals.\n“California may be first, but it clearly will not end here,” he warned. “Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Newsom's speech as performative.\n“I know Gavin Newsom had a big address to the nation last night — I guess he thought that’s what it was for maybe his future political ambitions,” Leavitt said Wednesday. “But he spoke a lot of words. We haven’t seen action.”\nThe filing this week wasn’t the first time this year that California had sued the Trump administration. In April, Newsom filed a lawsuit that challenged Trump’s authority to impose sweeping tariffs that the governor asserted would inflate prices and inflict billions of dollars in damage to California, which has the nation’s largest economy.\nAnd California — not just Newsom — continues to be a foil.\nJust this month, the Trump administration signaled that it intends to cut off federal funding for a long-delayed California high-speed rail project plagued by multibillion-dollar cost overruns. He’s threatened to pull federal funding in California if the state did not bar transgender students from participating in girls sports. The Justice Department warned districts they could face legal trouble if they don’t bar trans athletes from competition.\nAnd on Thursday, he's expected to sign a measure blocking California's vehicle emissions rules.\n___\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Blood from Los Angeles.

            "Trump's mass deportations leave Democrats more ready to fight back. Trump's mass deportations leave Democrats more ready to fight back\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom looked straight into the camera and offered a stark moment for his Democratic Party\nWASHINGTON -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom looked straight into the camera and staked out a clear choice for his Democratic Party.\nThe governor positioned himself as not only a leader of the opposition to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, but a de facto champion of the immigrants now being rounded up in California and across the country. Many of them, he said in the video address, were not hardened criminals, but hard-working people scooped up at a Home Depot lot or a garment factory, and detained by masked agents assisted by National Guard troops.\nIt’s a politically charged position for the party to take, after watching voter discontent with illegal immigration fuel Trump's return to the White House. It leaves Democrats deciding how strongly to align with that message in the face of blistering criticism from Republicans who are pouring billions of dollars into supporting Trump’s strict immigration campaign.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday he's proud of Newsom, “he’s refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.”\nFrom the streets of Los Angeles to the halls of Congress, the debate over Trump’s mass deportation agenda is forcing the U.S. to reckon with core values as a nation of immigrants, but also its long-standing practice of allowing migrants to live and work in the U.S. in a gray zone while not granting them full legal status. More than 11 million immigrants are in the U.S. without proper approval, with millions more having arrived with temporary protections.\nAs Trump’s administration promises to round up some 3,000 immigrants a day and deport 1 million a year, the political stakes are shifting in real time. The president rode to the White House with his promise of mass deportations — rally crowds echoed his campaign promise to “build the wall.” But Americans are watching as Trump deploys the National Guard and active U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, while pockets of demonstrations erupt in other cities nationwide, including after agents raided a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska\nJoel Payne, a Democratic strategist, said the country’s mood appears to be somewhere between then-President Barack Obama’s assertion that America is “a nation of immigrants, we’re also a nation of laws” and Trump’s “more aggressive” deportation approach.\n“Democrats still have some work to do to be consistently trustworthy messengers on the issue,” he said.\nAt the same time, he said, Trump’s actions as a “chaos agent” on immigration when there's already unrest over his trade wars and economic uncertainty, risk overreaching if the upheaval begins to sow havoc in the lives of Americans.\nRepublicans have been relentless in their attacks on Democrats, portraying the situation in Los Angeles, which has been largely confined to a small area downtown, in highly charged terms as “riots,” in a preview of campaign ads to come.\nPolice said more than 200 people were detained for failing to disperse on Tuesday, and 17 others for violating the 8 p.m. curfew over part of Los Angeles. Police arrested several more people for possessing a firearm, assaulting a police officer and other violations. Two people have been charged for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails toward police during LA protests.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Newsom should be “tarred and feathered” for his leadership in the state, which he called “a safe haven to violent criminal illegal aliens.”\nAt a private meeting of House Republicans this week with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Rep. Richard Hudson, the chairman of the GOP’s campaign arm, framed the situation as Democrats supporting rioting and chaos while Republicans stand for law and order.\n“Violent insurrectionists turned areas of Los Angeles into lawless hellscapes over the weekend,” wrote Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., earlier this week in the Wall Street Journal, suggesting it may be time to send in military troops.\n“The American people elected Donald Trump and a Republican Congress to secure our border and deport violent illegal aliens. That’s exactly what the president is doing.”\nBut not all rank-and-file Republicans are on board with such a heavy-handed approach.\nGOP Rep, David Valadao, who represents California's agriculture regions in the Central Valley, said on social media he remains “concerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA” and was urging the administration “to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years.”\nHeading into the 2026 midterm election season, with control of the House and Senate at stake, it's a repeat of past political battles, as Congress has failed repeatedly to pass major immigration law changes.\nThe politics have shifted dramatically from the Obama era, when his administration took executive action to protect young immigrants known as Dreamers under the landmark Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\nThose days, lawmakers were considering proposals to beef up border security as part of a broader package that would also create legal pathways, including for citizenship, for immigrants who have lived in the country for years and paid taxes, some filling roles in jobs Americans won't always take.\nWith Trump’s return to the Oval Office, the debate has turned toward aggressively removing immigrants, including millions who were allowed to legally enter the U.S. during the Biden administration, as they await their immigration hearings and proceedings.\n“This anniversary should be a reminder,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., at a Wednesday event at the U.S. Capitol championing DACA’s 13th year, even as protections are at risk under Trump’s administration. “Immigration has many faces.”\nDespite their challenges in last year's election, Democrats feel more emboldened to resist Trump's actions than even just a few months ago, but the political conversation has nonetheless shifted in Trump's direction.\nWhile Democrats are unified against Trump's big tax breaks bill, with its $150 billion for new detention facilities, deportation flights and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, they talk more openly about beefing up border security and detaining the most dangerous criminal elements.\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, points to the example of Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who won a special election in New York last year when he addressed potential changes to the immigration system head-on. At one point, he crashed a GOP opponent’s news conference with his own.\n“Trump said he was going to go after the worst of the worst, but he has ignored the laws, ignored due process, ignored the courts — and the American people reject that,” she told The Associated Press.\n“People want a president and a government that is going to fight for the issues that matter most to them, fight to move our country forward,” she said. “They want a Congress that is going to be a coequal branch of government and a check on this president.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Matt Brown contributed to this story."

            "If You Deal With Pain From Sciatica, An Expert Says These Products May Help. If you deal with pain or discomfort from sciatica, you’re not alone. Up to 40% of people in the U.S. experience the condition at some point in their lives.\nCharacterized by irritation of the sciatic nerve in the lower back (or lumbar spine) region, sciatica “usually feels like a deep throbbing pain that radiates from the back or buttocks,” said physical therapist Chris DeRosa. DeRosa, who is a co-owner of Los Angeles-based Davis and DeRosa Physical Therapy, specializes in lower back pain and sciatica, among other issues.\nSciatica-related pain often continues down the leg and can travel as far as one’s toes, DeRosa noted, and may be accompanied by numbness or tingling.\nAccording to DeRosa, because these symptoms are typically (though not always) muscular in origin, targeted exercises and physical therapy can be immensely helpful in improving sciatica and even resolving the condition completely.\n“Sciatica is 100% treatable in most cases, and your physical therapist is your best line of defense,” DeRosa said. “Especially when symptoms first arise.”\nDeRosa recommended some equipment that, in conjunction with proper exercises, can help assuage pain from sciatica. Before using any of the tools, be sure to consult with a physical therapist or doctor.\nGentle stretching with a dedicated nylon strap tool\nAccording to DeRosa, if a patient with sciatica has been clinically diagnosed with muscular symptoms, \"the piriformis muscle, or as I call it, the 'pain in butt muscle,' is usually the culprit.\"\n\"Sometimes, self-massage using a foam roller or massage gun/ball, followed by gentle stretching, can help with the symptoms and [be] part of our prescription for recovery,\" DeRosa said.\nDeRosa recommended this six-foot Stretch Out Strap for gently stretching the legs and upper and lower body. It's designed with 10 loops that help you stretch with greater control; you can also use the loops as comfy yet grippy handholds.\nThe tool also comes with a stretching exercise booklet and access to a video stretching guide.\nA supportive lower back brace with 40,000 5-star ratings\nIn addition, DeRosa recommended this popular back support belt, designed to soothe lower back pain through firm yet comfortable support.\nThe belted brace is made with breathable, flexible mesh, so it’ll stabilize your back while still allowing for natural movement. You can also make use of its removable lumbar pad for days when you need additional stability and targeted compression.\nAnother plus, according to reviewers, is that the brace is subtle enough to wear under clothes if you prefer, lacking the bulkiness characteristic of other models.\nIt’s available in three colors and in sizes XS-XXXL.\nClip the coupon for an additional discount at checkout.\nSelf-massaging, including with a vibration therapy massage ball\nDeRosa also recommended the Hyperice vibrating massage ball for gently massaging the piriformis muscle in your gluteal area.\nSmall enough to fit in your palm, the massage ball offers three vibration speeds to help soothe muscle stiffness and soreness.\nA budget-friendly foam roller for gentle exercise\nDeRosa also recommended this foam roller from Healthy You for gentle stretching and self-massaging.\nThe roller is made with medium-firm foam that's dense and durable yet slightly soft to the touch. It comes in three sizes, though DeRosa recommended the largest size (36 inches long).\nA reviewer-favorite roller that offers penetrating massages\nPer DeRosa's advice to invest in a foam roller, we think this textured massage roller is a good option for folks wanting the stretch of a roller and the precise targeting of a more specialized tool.\nThis \"next level\" medium-density foam roller is super popular among Amazon reviewers, who've given it 28,000 5-star ratings. It's designed with three zones so you can customize your self-massage: a \"palm\" area that mimics the feeling of a light massage; a \"finger\" zone created for tissue flushing and an especially intense \"thumb\" region with projecting nodes.\nOr an extra-textured roller for even more intensity\nIf you're seeking an especially intense massage, we think this deep tissue roller is a solid choice. The tool's firm textured bumps are supposed to deeply penetrate into muscles while the spaces in between allow for movement of your soft tissue.\nSomething of a hidden-gem recovery tool, the piece has earned 4.7 out of 5 stars on Amazon. \"It's amazing how much of a difference the Rumble Roller has made in my life,\" wrote one reviewer. \"The roller really helped 'loosen' things up and significantly decrease[d] the pain and stiffness that I was suffering from.\"\nThe roller is available in an \"original\" firm style and an extra-firm version. You can also grab it in several sizes.\nOr self-massage using specialized deep-massage tools\nIn addition, DeRosa suggested this trio of massage balls for massaging the gluteal area.\nDesigned to address muscle pain across the body, the rubber set includes a textured ball for targeting \"trigger\" points, a spiky ball for more intense tension relief and a firm, smooth ball for precise muscle massage.\nClip the coupon for an additional discount at checkout.\nA muscle-massaging ball you can use while standing\nBased on DeRosa's recommendation of self-massage balls, we think this mountable massage ball would be a good choice for anyone who'd prefer to stand up while working out knots.\nThis trigger point ball is designed to create an airtight seal against a smooth, non-porous wall, so you can target tense muscles more precisely without having to lie down.\nThe device is meant to be used for up to 30 minutes, after which you should unclamp the tool from your wall to preserve the tool's longevity and suction; the massage ball is not designed for permanent mounting.\nA handheld massage gun to relieve stiffness and tension\nDeRosa also suggested the Hyperice percussion massager for targeting muscles in the gluteal region.\nDesigned to loosen knots and soothe stiffness, the device has three speeds and two interchangeable heads (which you can swap out depending on your needs). Available in two colors, it's lightweight enough for you to carry with you and, according to reviewers, impressively quiet given its 40-watt motor.\nOr a unique heated back wrap with massage capability\nDeRosa also recommended Hyperice's heat and massage back wrap for soothing lower back pain.\nThe warming, vibrating wrap heats up six times faster than a standard heating pad, according to the brand, with an exceptionally large surface area that allows it to target discomfort more evenly and consistently than other options.\nYou can choose between three massage levels and three heat levels with the controller attached to the wrap. The device is made with comfy neoprene, which you can adjust to your desired level of compression.\nThe heated massager is also available in dedicated versions for legs and the right and left shoulders.\nA set of resistance bands with handles\n“Our number one choice is usually resistance bands with handles,” DeRosa explained to HuffPost. “They are cost effective and come in varied resistance so people can use lighter or stronger bands if they feel the exercises [are] too easy or too hard.\"\nDeRosa recommended this five-pack of bands to start off with.\n“Routines with the bands can be used to build upper body strength and lower body strength and of course should never be painful when performing,” he said. “We always like to incorporate functional exercises, like sit to stand from a chair or bed and supported step ups as these are weight-bearing exercises that not only build strength but also help increase bone density [since] our bone density decreases as we age.”\nA pair of ankle weights\n\"Adjustable ankle weights are great for doing upper and lower body exercises and allow you to increase or decrease resistance as needed,\" DeRosa explained.\nDeRosa recommended this pair of ankle weights, which are each adjustable from one to five pounds. They also have adjustable straps to ensure a comfortable fit. They're available in multiple colors and with higher weight offerings.\nAn under-desk elliptical machine\n\"[The] Cubii elliptical machine is a great way to increase lower body strength, ROM [an exercise technique to improve joint flexibility and mobility] and build some cardiovascular endurance,\" DeRosa wrote.\nThe Cubii elliptical, which DeRosa specifically recommended, is compact, portable and offers adjustable peddling resistance. It fits easily under couches, arm chairs and desk chairs so you can enjoy a low-impact workout while sitting at home. It also has Bluetooth connectivity and an app that tracks your strides, time and more.\nShort balance activities, like the ones in this training book\n“Falls are one of the most common way seniors injure themselves. Incorporating safe balance training to a program is essential,” said DeRosa. He recommended this book to get started, and also noted that many older folks enjoy chair yoga to improve balance and overall strength.",
            "The benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts. Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\nOnce a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.\nNordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn’t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others — she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.\n“I run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,” said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.\n“Some of those things come very easy — like, they’re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can’t wait to get to them,” Nordmeyer said. “And some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.”\nWhat Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as “body doubling,” a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder — especially during the pandemic.\n“The idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,” said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. “For folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.”\nBody doubling isn’t just for people with ADHD, but like many “coping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,” said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania’s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.\nWhy body doubling works\nA neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity — so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.\nIf people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.\n“It also draws on our social selves,” Ramsay said. “A lot of people with ADHD will say, ‘I have a hard time getting started on this if I’m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I’m more likely to go and be there because I don’t want to let them down.’”\nThere doesn’t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. “But I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,” Roberts said.\nIn theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it.\nHow to use body doubling effectively\nBody doubling can help with pretty much any task you’re having a hard time getting done — whether that’s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn’t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for — such as exercising — requires that assistance.\nBe choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said — not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.\n“It’s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,” Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner.\nAsking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, “It’s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.”\nYou could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, “You help me organize my garage on Saturday; I’ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,” Ramsay said.\nThose small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added.\nScheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double.\n“It depends on the individual,” Roberts said. “If it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.”\nVirtual body doubling\nIf you don’t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren’t out of luck.\nSome TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they’re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.\nIn virtual sessions, “most body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,” Nordmeyer said. “The purpose of that is to make sure you’re still in your chair working. … But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.”\nThe benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces — which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don’t have someone to ask, Roberts said.\n“Some people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,” he added. “You saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.\n“We all think and work differently, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Roberts said.",
            "Couples who cuddle before sleep reap key health benefits, study reveals. Snuggling with your partner could be a win-win for your health.\nCuddling at night promotes more secure attachment between partners and lowers stress levels, according to a new study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.\nResearchers from Auburn University examined data from 143 heterosexual \"bed-sharing\" couples, analyzing associations between physical closeness at sleep onset, perceived stress, attachment insecurity and sleep disturbance.\nMOST SLEEP-DEPRIVED CITIES IN US REVEALED IN REPORT: WHERE DOES YOURS RANK?\nFactors including daytime sleepiness, income, age, relationship length, sleep diagnoses and whether children or pets sleep in the bed were also considered.\nThe results revealed that couples who assumed a physically closer position upon going to sleep were indirectly linked with \"lower couple insecure attachment\" (when they have trouble connecting emotionally) and lower stress.\nThe researchers found no \"significant\" associations between physical closeness at sleep onset and the chances of sleep disturbance.\nWhile stress was found to be lower among cuddlers, the research found that cuddling did not increase sleep quality.\nThe researchers concluded that physical closeness at sleep onset \"may be a promising and amenable avenue for improving relational and physiological well-being.\"\nHERE'S WHY 90% OF AMERICANS DON'T SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT, ACCORDING TO EXPERT\nSleep expert Wendy Troxel, PhD — a RAND Corporation senior behavioral specialist and licensed clinical psychologist in Utah — shared with Fox News Digital how these findings highlight the \"vital role\" that shared time and physical touch play in emotional well-being.\nTroxel, author of the book \"Sharing the Covers: Every Couple’s Guide to Better Sleep,\" commented on the \"interesting\" finding that cuddling did not influence sleep quality.\n\"This suggests that it’s the moments spent together before falling asleep — not necessarily sharing the entire night — that have the greatest positive effect on a relationship,\" said the expert, who was not involved in the study.\n\"The simple act of cuddling before sleep likely triggers powerful psychological and physiological responses, such as increased emotional security and the release of oxytocin — the ‘bonding hormone’ associated with intimacy.\"\nHEAT EXPOSURE LINKED TO BETTER SLEEP, EXPERTS SAY — HERE'S WHY\nThese effects help reduce stress and deepen connection, which makes pre-sleep cuddling a \"meaningful ritual for emotional health,\" Troxel said.\n\"Whether you and your partner sleep together or apart, don’t skip the cuddle before bed,\" she advised. \"Even brief moments of closeness can enhance your relationship and overall well-being.\"\nWhile the study found that most couples sleep in the same position as their partner, 36.3% reported not touching or cuddling at night.\nThose who did touch reported sleeping back to back (19.6%), having some contact, like touching an arm or leg (23.1%), spooning (13.3%), intertwining (4.2%) and sleeping face to face (3.5%).\nStudy co-author Josh R. Novak, PhD, associate professor at the Auburn University Department of Human Development and Family Science, confirmed in a statement to Fox News Digital that the more physically close position couples are in, the more feelings of \"relational safety\" were present due to lower stress.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Sleep is one of the most important ways we can manage our physical, relational and mental health,\" the researcher said.\n\"Research has substantiated that sleep and relationship functioning are bidirectional and cyclical — meaning that bad sleep can negatively impact your relationship, and difficult relationship dynamics can lead to worse sleep.\"\n\"Sleep is one of the most important ways we can manage our physical, relational and mental health.\"\nNovak added that non-sexual physical affection has generally been deemed \"critical\" for relationships, but there seems to be more \"emotional and relational benefit\" when there's full-body contact.\n\"My study suggests that cuddling with a partner can be both a barometer of how a relationship is doing and a way to maintain or repair a relationship, as well as lower stress levels,\" he said.\nThe researchers did not study how much time was spent in a cuddling position, leaving Novak to be \"skeptical\" of whether it leads to sleep disturbances.\n\"What happens most often is that cuddling only happens for a bit until both partners fall asleep, but there could be a select few that cuddle throughout the whole night,\" he said.\nFor more Health articles, visit foxnews.com/health\n\"My hunch is that most use cuddling to induce sleepiness and the feeling of safety and to reduce stress and anxiety, and that afterward either their body temperature increases too much, or there is discomfort and the need to shift around becomes necessary.\"\nNovak encouraged couples to cuddle if stress levels are high, as it's a nonverbal way to feel \"secure and safe.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Although research needs to substantiate this further, it might also imply that, in the face of conflict during the day that is not solved or repaired … cuddling might be a way to start that process and move toward repair,\" he added."

            "Louisiana pharmacy bill stirs fierce debate, prompts CVS texts warning of closures. A bill that could reshape the landscape of Louisiana pharmacies emerged on the second-to-last day of the legislative session, provoking a furious debate on the House floor and a massive public lobbying campaign from drug-store chain CVS.\nHouse Bill 358 surfaced Wednesday afternoon from a conference committee with a major new addition: It would ban pharmacy benefit managers from owning pharmacies. The goal, supporters said, is to stop those big companies from using their buying power to squeeze out local independent pharmacies and give consumers fewer choices.\nBut CVS, which owns both a pharmacy benefits manager and a chain of drugstores, said the bill would force them to close 119 Louisiana pharmacies, affecting 1 million patients across the state and 22,000 patients who receive high-cost specialty drugs that smaller pharmacies could find difficult to handle.\nIt would also put 2,700 CVS employees out of work, the drug retailer said.\nThe company launched a massive lobbying campaign, including text messages to CVS customers urging them to reach out to their lawmakers.\n“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text said.\nThe ad blitz infuriated some lawmakers, who said they were standing up to massive companies that have choked independent, local pharmacies and squeezed consumers over drug prices. They blasted CVS for using “fear tactics” to scare their constituents.\n“It is about time something in this building we have done tells a national industry we’re not going to stand for it anymore,” said Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge.\nHe referenced some of the messaging CVS had sent out that said lawmakers were threatening to close pharmacies.\n“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.\nCVS officials said the impacts of the bill would be far-reaching.\n“We feel it will cripple your health care access and affordability in Louisiana,” said Lucille Accetta, chief pharmacy officer of CVS. “It is shutting us completely down as a trusted health care pharmacy.”\nShe added that, should the legislation take effect, it would precipitate a “health care crisis” and said neither legislators nor the governor understand the impact of the proposed policy change on constituents.\nThe House passed the bill on an 88-4 vote.\nThe Senate had already gaveled out on Wednesday before the bill emerged from conference committee. The upper chamber will also need to agree to the change on Thursday — the last day of the session — before it can go to Gov. Jeff Landry’s desk for a signature.\nLandry backs the bill.\n“Drug prices soaring? Thank PBMs, the Profiteering Big Money, for gaming the system,” Landry wrote on X. “They hurt patients and small businesses. No more, not here — let’s rein in PBMs now!\"\nA debate over PBMs\nThe battle over PBMs emerged late in the session and swiftly became one of the most hotly debated topics in the waning legislative session.\nPBMs are companies that negotiate lower drug prices by acting as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies. PBM supporters say they can help keep drug costs down, but critics argue they pocket too much of the savings.\nPreviously, public legislative debate centered around House Bill 264, which would bar pharmacy benefit managers from steering customers to their own pharmacies. It would also require that discounts they negotiate go to employers and consumers.\nHB264 also requires pharmacy benefit managers to report more details of their activities to government regulators to ensure that they are following the law.\nOn Wednesday, though, a different bill became the center of attention: House Bill 358. That bill was originally designed to set new rules for when pharmacy technicians can work remotely, and had passed both the House and the Senate.\nBut the bill emerged from a conference committee — a process in which a group of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate works behind closed doors to negotiate between the two chambers — with the new language addressing PBMs.\n“No permit to operate a pharmacy shall be granted or renewed to a pharmacy that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by a pharmacy benefit manager or its subsidiary,” that language said.\nCVS and a handful of legislators criticized that process, arguing a major change to policy that could affect thousands of people was being added at the last minute with little public debate.\n“A backroom deal isn’t the best way to proceed,” said Accetta.\nIf the change is something that lawmakers are seriously considering, they should do appropriate research, hold public hearings and understand the economic impact to the state, she said.\nBut Rep. Dustin Miller, an Opelousas Democrat who is sponsoring HB358, said the issue has been debated for years in various parts of the legislature. He also said the bill wouldn’t take effect for a full year, giving CVS time to make the changes it needs to keep the pharmacies open.\n“We have set the effective date of this bill January 2027,” he said. “We will be here and have a whole other session if there is anything that we have to address.”\nArkansas previously passed a similar bill, and CVS has filed a lawsuit trying to stop it.\nAsked if legal action could be on the table should the measure become law, CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said, “We will do anything and everything that we can to keep our pharmacy operations up and running in Louisiana.”\nConcerns about specialty drugs\nAccetta said the legislation would force CVS to stop sending specialty drugs to patients in Louisiana for chronic or complex conditions like cancer, hemophilia and multiple sclerosis.\n“We’re specially trained in these therapies typically not seen in independent pharmacies,” she said. “In some cases we are the only distributor of those drugs across this country.”\nMiller said there are plenty of pharmacies in the state that can handle specialty drugs, but PBMs often decline to fill prescriptions at those pharmacies because they’re trying to steer patients to the pharmacies they own.\n“There are pharmacies available to do all of the specialty items that they’re talking about. They’ve just never been given the opportunity,” he said.\nRep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, one of the few votes against HB358, said she wanted to vote for the bill but could not due to desperate texts from her constituents.\n“I’ve gotten messages like: ‘Is there any way this can be stopped? I’m literally sobbing because my husband will die without this specialty medicine,’” said Landry.\nBut Beryl Amedée, R-Gray, who supported the bill, complained that PBMs made it unnecessarily difficult for her sister, who battled brain cancer and died after 10 months, to get her chemotherapy drugs.\n“I can’t tell you the hours and days that she should have been sitting with her grandchildren, but she was instead having to come and fight with pharmaceutical companies, with PBMs,” Amedée said.\nAmedée said the PBMs made her sister follow seemingly arbitrary rules and it often felt that her health was not their main consideration.\n“I think I know what their consideration was. It’s called the bottom line,” she added.",
            "Louisiana Senate kills pharmacy bill; Gov. Jeff Landry could call special session. With just an hour left in the regular session, the Louisiana Senate on Thursday killed a controversial bill that would have barred companies from owning both pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacies.\nThat decision defied Gov. Jeff Landry, who said he would call the legislature back in for a special session to address the PBM issue.\n“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens. It's that important!\" Landry said in a statement through a spokesperson.\nIt was not clear when Landry might issue that call.\nSenate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said senators had concerns about the rapid pace at which House Bill 358 was being considered — it only emerged from a conference committee with the language addressing PBMs Wednesday afternoon.\n“There’s a legislative process for a reason,” Henry said. “That amendment did not have one ounce of public testimony through the process.”\nHenry pointed out that the bill would not have taken effect until 2027 anyway, had it passed, which meant the Legislature could simply vote on the bill next year.\n“I don’t know why you would call a special session for a bill that doesn’t take effect until 2027,” Henry said.\nWhat the bills do\nRather than approve the governor’s preferred policy change, the Senate passed a last-minute resolution asking for a study on the impact of prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies, a practice known as “vertical integration.”\nAnd the Legislature passed a bill that would set new rules for how those companies can operate, requiring them to pass more of their savings on prescription drugs to consumers and barring them from requiring customers to use their drug stores.\nThe series of political maneuvers and votes came after a ferocious, last-minute lobbying battle between some of the country’s largest PBMs —including CVS, which sent a barrage of text messages to customers urging opposition to the bill — and Landry, who publicly pressured legislators to restrict the PBM giants.\nHB358 would have banned companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies. Supporters argue doing so would stop big companies from pushing out independent pharmacies.\nPBMs act as middlemen between pharmacies, health care plans and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug costs, but critics say they have too much power over the drug market, drive out competition and limit where people can get their prescriptions filled.\nCVS, which owns both a PBM and a nationwide chain of drug stores, said the bill would have forced it to close its 119 stores in Louisiana, affecting about 1 million patients across the state and 22,000 patients who receive high-cost specialty drugs that smaller pharmacies could find difficult to handle.\n“Our focus remains on serving the people of Louisiana: lowering drug costs, providing access to care, and helping improve health,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault after the Legislature adjourned. “We look forward to working productively with policymakers to continue to make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible and promoting the value of community pharmacy.”\nIn the hours before the session’s 6 p.m. deadline, Landry and other PBM critics took to social media to pressure legislators.\nLandry, who for days had been publicly urging the Legislature to pass the PBM-pharmacy prohibition, said in a post on X hours before the end of the session that he could quickly call lawmakers back into a special session should they reject the measure.\nDonald Trump Jr., the president’s son, weighed in on the PBM political battle 20 minutes later with a post on X: “Louisiana, it’s time to pass HB358 and end the charade that costs hard-working Americans so much money when buying prescription drugs.”\nThe House on Wednesday approved the bill on an 88-4 vote. But the Senate did not bring it up for a vote Thursday.\nInstead, its members passed without opposition a resolution, SR 209 sponsored by Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, asking the Louisiana Department of Health to study the idea of implementing the rules sought in HB358.\nThe House ultimately unanimously approved House Bill 264 by Rep. Michael Echols, R-Monroe, which establishes new rules for PBMs. In addition to requiring more money go to customers, the bill requires PBMs to disclose more information to the state.\nOn the House floor, Echols said HB264 includes “stronger oversight tools,” protects consumers, enhances transparency and addresses “heinous practices” by PBMs.\n\"Today is a giant leap forward, and we keep our promise to you to fix these problems.\" Echols said. \"We're not done. I think we're just beginning, but this opens a big door for us to go through.\"\nTalbot said HB264 was a sign that “the big pharmacies are on notice now.” And he said the Senate may be open in the future to banning vertical integration.\n“It ain’t over,” Talbot said.\nText messages draw ire of state leaders\nCVS’s decision to send text message blasts urging customers to oppose HB358 infuriated state leaders.\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she would issue a cease-and-desist demand letter over the texts.\nShe also announced an investigation into CVS over the text messages, saying that using patient contact information for lobbying may not be “an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.”\nCaremark, which is part of the CVS family of companies, is a PBM for the state government.\nGov. Jeff Landry slammed CVS on social media saying, “Abusing patients’ sensitive information to push a political message is completely unethical and manipulative and we will not stand for it.”\nThibault, the CVS spokesperson, said in a statement the company's communications with its customers, patients and community members were \"consistent with the law.\"\n\"We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\" she said.\nEchols said the legislature could not be bullied, because it always sides with Louisianans.\nControversy as the clock ran out\nDebate over HB 358 exploded in the last two days of the session.\nThe bill was originally designed to allow pharmacy technicians to access pharmacy records and systems remotely. But on Wednesday afternoon, it emerged from a conference committee — where lawmakers from each chamber meet behind closed doors to work through disagreements — to add the provision about pharmacy and PBM ownership.\nCVS hads blasted that process, saying the state was making a major change to pharmacy laws at the last minute with no public hearings.\nSupporters argued the restriction on PBMs would stop big corporations from having an unfair advantage that has led to the closure of independent pharmacies.\nIndependent pharmacies have been getting reimbursed less and less every year “because the PBMs want to make their own pockets fatter,” Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, who is sponsoring HB 358, said on the House floor Wednesday.\n“I think it’s time that we tell PBMs you have to choose: You’re either a PBM or you’re a pharmacy in Louisiana,” Miller said.\nLawmakers in favor the change said they weren’t forcing any pharmacies to close.\nBut Thibault said, “It’s not possible to operate a PBM in all states but one.”\n“PBMs serve employers with people in multiple states. You can’t have a state-by-state PBM, so we don’t have a choice,” she said.\nArkansas passed a similar earlier this year. CVS has filed a lawsuit seeking to block it from taking effect.\nPatients react to CVS campaign\nOn Thursday, a steady trickle of customers picked up prescriptions as usual at stores on Magazine Street and Prytania Street.\nAfter a morning of doctors’ appointments, Cynthia Marshall, 72, stopped to pick up a prescription after seeing a text message from CVS. She hadn’t had a chance to learn more about the bill, but said there were alternatives if the store did close.\n“We would probably just go to Walgreens,” said Marshall.\nBut Marshall said Walgreens is small, and she was concerned about it taking on the patient load of closed stores.\nAlong with the text campaign, CVS stores across Louisiana hung colorful “Save our Store” posters at their entrances, and some locations even passed out flyers to customers.\nJordan Hefler, of Baton Rouge, stopped at a CVS store Wednesday and said the cashier handed her a “Save our Store” flyer containing a QR code. The employee urged her to sign a petition.\nHefler was initially confused and worried about CVS stores closing. But she said she looked into the issue and realized it was more “complicated” and “probably not as immediate as it was made to sound.”\nSome CVS patrons said they had not heard of the news, and weren’t too worried about it.\nAllen Hall, of Watson, uses the pharmacy at the Denham Springs CVS and said Thursday he had not received any texts from CVS or heard about possible closures.\n“If they shut down, I’ll just go somewhere else,” Hall said.",
            "Pharmacy benefits managers are at the center of Louisiana's drug debate. What are they?. With less than 24 hours left in the legislative session, Louisiana lawmakers are locked in a fierce battle over a proposal that would change the way pharmacies are allowed to operate in the state.\nLast-minute changes made to House Bill 358 have prompted a massive public lobbying campaign from drugstore chain CVS, with a text message sent to customers Wednesday afternoon that said the legislation \"threatens to close your CVS pharmacy.\"\nThe legislation, designed to favor independent pharmacies, would ban pharmacy benefits managers from owning or partially owning pharmacies in Louisiana, a move that supporters say represents a strong pushback against corporations squeezing consumers.\nIf passed, the bill would force the closure of over 100 CVS pharmacies in Louisiana, company officials say.\nIf HB 358 is signed into law, it would not go into effect until 2026.\nHere's what to know.\nWhat is a pharmacy benefits manager?\nPharmacy benefits managers are companies that negotiate lower drug prices by acting as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies.\nTheir roles have expanded over the decades and PBMs are now at the center of drug distribution. Supporters say they can help keep costs down, but critics argue benefit managers pocket too much of the savings.\nPBMs purchase drugs from drug wholesalers. They are also responsible for deciding which drugs are and aren't covered by your insurance, and how much you have to pay for prescription drugs.\nAccording to a 2024 report from the Federal Trade Commission, the top three PBMs in the country include CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx. Together, the FTC says they manage 79% of of prescriptions filled in the U.S. for about 270 million people. The FTC launched a broad investigation into pharmacy benefit managers in 2022.\nOther state legislatures have moved to restrict PBMs in recent years, including Arkansas, California, Maine and New York. Congress also aimed to pass legislation last year to regulate PBMs.\nPharmacy operations in Louisiana\nHow could the bill affect where Louisianans can get their prescriptions filled? The full scope of the legislation is still coming into view.\nCVS retail pharmacies are owned by PBM CVS-Caremark, and officials say the bill's passage would close hundreds of their neighborhood pharmacies. CVS-Caremark also owns a mail service pharmacy, though it's unclear if those operations would be affected by the bill.\nLocal, independent pharmacies would not be directly affected by the bill. According to the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, there are roughly 400 independent community pharmacies in the state. You can find your closest independent pharmacy on their website.\nWhat's next?\nHB 358 has already received approval from House members.\nNow, on the last day of the session, it must go before state Senate for final approval. The Senate is set to gavel in at 9 a.m. Thursday.\nThen, lawmakers in the chamber could choose to vote to approve the bill as is, make amendments or outright reject the bill.\nIf a majority of senators do decide to approval the bill in its current form, it is likely to receive Gov. Jeff Landry's signature, the last step a bill needs before becoming a law.\nLandry has already given public support for the bill, praising it on X Wednesday."

            "CDC workers fired from prominent STI, hepatitis labs are rehired. The staff of two world-class laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were slated to be closed in a round of cuts announced in April have been informed that their terminations have been canceled.\nThe CDC’s sexually transmitted disease laboratory and its viral hepatitis laboratory were targets of layoffs initiated by the U.S. Doge Service that was led by Elon Musk. But last Thursday, the 55 full-time employees of the two laboratories were notified by email that their terminations had been rescinded, two people who received the notifications told STAT.\nThe emails came from the same Office of Human Resources account that notified workers of their dismissals. No reason for the reversal was given.\nThe staff of the two labs are among roughly 450 CDC workers whose firings have been reportedly reversed.\nIn an emailed statement, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, explained the reversal by saying the Trump administration “is committed to protecting essential services.”\n“HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority,” she said.\nThe two people who spoke to STAT did so on the condition their names would not be made public, because they fear reprisals.\nOne of the individuals said the leadership of the department and center they worked in first learned that the labs would be spared after all from staff who had received the notices. They had not been informed by the CDC’s office of the director or by the Department of Health and Human Services. (The CDC is currently without a director; nominee Susan Monarez has not yet had her Senate confirmation hearing.)\nThough the workers are relieved the labs will be saved — “It’s great news,” one said — their relief is tempered with uncertainty about whether another round of cuts could come with next year’s budget, and what work conditions will be like at the CDC going forward.\nThey do, however, expect a persistent sense of chaos. The employees of the two labs had lost all access to the CDC — both its physical campuses and its online networks. Those have not yet been restored. And while the staff of at least one of the laboratories hopes to be back at work next week, that will require the reissuing of identification passes and the restoration of email addresses.\nBoth laboratories may be down several workers when activity resumes. A few of the employees had accepted jobs elsewhere, sources said. Some were said to be trying to figure out whether to pass on those new positions now; at least a few appear to have decided that working at the CDC was no longer tenable.\n“This has been very grueling,” one of the newly unfired lab workers said in an interview.\nThe closure of these two laboratories horrified people in the infectious diseases world. Both labs provided critical national functions, but also were leaders internationally in efforts to monitor for and control the pathogens on which their work focused.\nIn the case of the STD lab, the closure came as gonorrhea appears poised to vanquish the last antibiotic that can reliably cure the infection. Since the dawn of antibiotics, the bacterium that causes it, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, has evolved to evade every antibiotic that has been used to treat it. There are two new antibiotics in the developmental pipeline, but if they get approved it will be critical to monitor for the inevitable development of resistance to them.\nBarbara Van Der Pol, a professor of medicine and public health in the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, had dreaded the possibility that new antibiotics for gonorrhea would be put into use without a good way to watch for resistance to them. In an interview in April, she likened it to a Wild West-type scenario, where “Everybody has a gun, but nobody knows when to use it.”\nShe welcomed the news that the lab will be saved. “This is such an important step of putting resources back where they are so very needed,” Van Der Pol said via email.\nIn the case of the viral hepatitis lab, the closure would have left the country with no ability to measure how big its problems are with hepatitis B and hepatitis C. The former is preventable, the latter curable. Left untreated, both can trigger liver cancer.\nJeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases, population, and public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine, was also relieved by the news these closures have been reversed.\n“Those laboratories provide critical activities in the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections and hepatitis. It was a mistake to close those laboratories,” said Klausner, who specializes in sexually transmitted infections.\n“The fact that [health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] accepted and addressed that mistake provides some additional confidence in his leadership,” he added. Klausner knows Kennedy personally and told STAT in April that he’d reached out to him to argue for reversing the STD lab closure.\nJohn Brooks, a fellow with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, also welcomed the news. But Brooks, who retired from the CDC last fall after a 26-year career there, said the treatment of agency staff whose jobs were cut in the so-called “reductions in force” or RIFs, has left them and their colleagues traumatized.\n“I think it’s hard for many people to imagine how demoralized the staff at CDC who’ve been affected by these RIFs are,” said Brooks, who was chief medical officer in the CDC’s division of HIV prevention when he retired. “Not only those who were RIF’ed for very unclear reasons, but those who were left behind who had to manage everything.’’",

            "RFK Jr., DOGE gutted legally required offices. Courts may undo it all.. RFK Jr., DOGE gutted legally required offices. Courts may undo it all.\nFederal workers, Democratic lawmakers, state officials and independent legal experts say keeping offices afloat in name only – with minimal or no staff – is an unconstitutional power grab.\nThe Trump administration’s purge of the health department is cutting so deep that it has incapacitated congressionally mandated programs and triggered legal challenges.\nThe administration insists the cuts are a lawful “streamlining” of a “bloated” agency, but federal workers, Democratic lawmakers, state officials and independent legal experts say keeping offices afloat in name only — with minimal or no staff — is an unconstitutional power grab.\nWhile agencies have some discretion over how to fulfill Congress’s demands, the upheaval inside the Department of Health and Human Services has claimed a host of programs the agency is required by Congress to maintain — cuts that are especially vulnerable to lawsuits and could upend Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s goal of slimming down a workforce he has repeatedly said is rife with waste, fraud and abuse.\nA federal judge Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s sweeping layoffs at several agencies, including HHS, saying that cooperation of the legislative branch is required for large-scale reorganizations.\nKennedy eliminated thousands of jobs in early April, paralyzing programs across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and particularly in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, that monitored health threats, researched cures and investigated everything from toxic fumes in fire stations to outbreaks of gonorrhea.\nThe layoffs at NIOSH have halted the National Firefighter Cancer Registry, Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. All are required by law, but their government websites explain they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n“If the law requires you, the executive, to do this work, you have, in a back door way, thumbed your nose at Congress by firing the people who are actually necessary to get that work done,” said Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, whose mission is supporting the federal workforce. “The executive branch is supposed to execute — the name says it all. It doesn’t have the right to determine where money is spent and how much money is spent. ”\nHHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told POLITICO that “critical initiatives under NIOSH will remain intact.”\n“The Trump administration is committed to taking care of coal miners and firefighters, who play a vital role in supporting this nation,” Nixon said. “HHS remains fully committed to supporting American families and delivering critical services as part of its reorganization to better serve the nation’s health.”\nThe CDC was aware, however, that the moves could be legally problematic. In early April, Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency team — which pushed federal agencies across the government to slash their workforce by thousands — flagged to the agency’s leadership that many programs on the chopping block were mandated by Congress and that cutting them posed a “litigation risk,” according to a memo sent to CDC and viewed by POLITICO.\nAnd while the administration has pledged that “essential services … will remain fully intact and uninterrupted” and has repeatedly claimed that core programs will transfer to the yet-to-be-created Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, interviews with staff and public notices on the CDC’s website show that the programs are no longer operational.\n“The idea that you can have a program with no people in it and no money in it, and that somehow, then you have not eliminated it — that’s just smoke and mirrors,” a high-level CDC official, granted anonymity for fear of retaliation, told POLITICO. “AHA, apparently, is where programs go to die.”\nThe “confidential” DOGE memo lists “statutory minimum requirements” for several CDC offices, including NIOSH, and details which programs are mandated by Congress and for which the health secretary has discretion. Some workplace health and safety programs, DOGE stressed, only have to be maintained “to the extent feasible.”\n“We could argue this delegation is no longer feasible,” the document says. “But there is a significant risk that a court would disagree.”\nDays after the memo was sent, the Trump administration eliminated most or all of the staff running several programs mandated by Congress, bringing their work to a halt. Some employees were brought back in early May but told their jobs would be gone again in the coming months.\nThe budget request the White House sent Congress on May 2 proposed slashing more than a quarter of HHS’ budget, a reduction of tens of billions of dollars, while allocating $500 million to the new “AHA” office that Kennedy said will take over many of the programs impacted by cuts. The budget also urges Congress to get rid of “duplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary programs,” including the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control — which the DOGE memo said the department is legally required to maintain.\nSome congressionally mandated programs saw their entire staff dismissed, including the firefighter cancer registry that was created by legislation President Donald Trump signed in his first term. Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, said she and every other member of the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer team received notices that their jobs would be eliminated this summer.\nThe cancer registry, along with NIOSH’s Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, all state on their government websites that they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n“I don’t know how they’re planning on actually doing … a meaningful scientific study, like it’s supposed to be, if there aren’t any scientists to work on that study,” Niemeier-Walsh said.\nOther programs lost most but not all of their staff, but federal workers said those layoffs have left those who remain unable to do their work.\nAn official in NIOSH’s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, granted anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said all but seven of the more than 75 workers in that office were given layoff notices, rendering it “no longer functioning.” A notice on the lab’s website reads: “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.”\nThe official warned that the cuts have not only wiped out their ability to test and certify new types of respirators — as required by Congress since 2001 — but also to inspect the thousands of breathing masks the lab already approved. The official predicted this will lead to an influx of shoddy or counterfeit respirators and the loss of the public’s trust in NIOSH’s certification.\nBeyond the laws requiring these programs exist, there are federal laws that require workers wear NIOSH-approved protective gear, including health care workers who use filtering facepiece respirators and firefighters who use self-contained breathing apparatuses.\nStier, an attorney, believes these Trump administration cuts go “beyond their legal institutional authority.” But stopping the layoffs and preventing new ones “really requires the courts to do their jobs, and Congress, to stand up to an executive invading their prerogatives,” he said.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration over the cuts, along with other unions representing federal workers and local government officials. They argued last week that “only Congress has the power to change the federal government in the ways the President has directed.”\nSenior U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco agreed, noting in her Friday ruling, which blocked Trump’s executive order, that while the president may reorganize the executive branch, “he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch.”\nThe Department of Justice appealed the ruling, and the next hearing is scheduled for May 22.\nNearly two dozen Democratic state attorneys general have also sued over the “evisceration of the Department’s statutorily mandated work promoting public health” in a Rhode Island federal court. Their complaint points in particular to cuts that have shuttered the CDC’s Atlanta-based lab that analyzes samples of sexually transmitted infections from around the country, citing a notice the agency posted April 11 listing nearly 100 kinds of tests that are “no longer performed at CDC” — including those for gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis.\nSome lawmakers, including those who drafted the legislation that created and funded the now-gutted programs, are also pushing back.\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sponsored the 1992 bill that created the CDC’s Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System when he served in the House. Every employee working on the program, which tracks the safety and success rates of every fertility clinic in the country, was put on administrative leave in April and told they would lose their jobs this summer.\n“Congress has the power of the purse,” Wyden said. “This law has been on the books — I’ve watched it carefully over the years. … It is stunning that somebody would call himself essentially Mr. Fertilization and then walk back [this] program,” he added, referencing Trump’s campaign statements in support of IVF.\nWyden joined with a dozen Democratic colleagues on a letter to Kennedy on Thursday demanding answers by May 16 to several question about cuts to the CDC team, including the justification for each worker’s termination, whether and when they will be reinstated, whether Elon Musk was involved in the decision to cut the team, and what will happen to the data IVF clinics continue to submit to the now-shuttered office.\nSome Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, are also telling administration officials and the public that they oppose the cuts, casting them as harmful to their constituents and a violation of Congress’ power. But other lawmakers, while expressing fear about the impact of the layoffs on workers in their states, said they trust the president to make things right without Congress’ involvement.\nWest Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice told POLITICO that he’s “concerned” but not “super nervous” about the layoffs in NIOSH’s Morgantown office that have hampered the congressionally mandated program which has screened coal miners for black lung disease for more than 50 years.\n“There is just plain no way that Donald Trump is going to do something to endanger the health of our coal miners — especially at the same time that we’re asking more of them,” he said, citing Trump’s call to increase domestic coal production. “Even if the jobs left us, which we don’t want to believe, I do believe they’re going to be merged into another organization. It may look a little different, but it will serve the purpose.”"

            "Greta Thunberg: Silence and Inaction Is More Deadly Than Me Sailing to Gaza. As Gaza faces over three months of Israeli blockade, a group of 12 activists is sailing to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid. The Madleen ship was launched by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and initially planned to sail from Malta last month, but the group’s ship was damaged in a drone attack. The new mission includes the renowned Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who speaks with Democracy Now! live from the Madleen. “We deem the risk of silence and the risk of inaction to be so much more deadly than this mission,” says Thunberg.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\nAs Gaza faces more than three months of a near-total Israeli blockade, activists are heading there now on a ship to deliver humanitarian aid. The boat is called the Madleen, named after Gaza’s first fisherwoman, who ran her father’s fishing business after he was injured in a 2009 Israeli attack. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition initially planned to sail from Malta last month, but their ship was damaged after it was bombed by drones in international waters. At Sunday’s launch of the Madleen from the Italian port of Catania, actor Liam Cunningham, known for his role in the series Game of Thrones, spoke out in support of the effort.\nLIAM CUNNINGHAM: My name is Liam. I’m from Ireland. The reason I’m here, as far as I’m concerned, the heart and soul of humanity is in Gaza. For me, this attack, this genocide, is not just on Palestinians. It is on the whole human race. These wonderful, brave people who are setting off on this boat, they are heroes. And also, the people of Gaza for the last 600 days are heroes. They are — in my mind, they will always be heroes.\nAMY GOODMAN: A group of 12 activists are carrying the aid for Gaza, including the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who will join us from the Madleen ship in a minute. She spoke Sunday at the launch.\nGRETA THUNBERG: A month after our latest attempt to go on with this mission, the boat was bombed twice. All evidence suggests Israel. And we are doing this because we have to keep our promise to the Palestinians to do everything in our power to protest against the genocide and to try to open up a humanitarian corridor.\nAMY GOODMAN: Since setting sail, passengers on the flotilla have faced many threats, including from U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who wrote on X, quote, “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!” unquote. The Gaza Freedom Flotilla has also been shadowed by at least one military helicopter and have reported drones circulating the ship. This is Thiago Ávila.\nTHIAGO ÁVILA: Hello, everyone. This is a new alert. We can clearly see a drone right now to our left. It’s gaining on us a little bit. We share this alert, second alert of the night, the third day of our journey to Gaza to break the siege and create a people’s humanitarian corridor aboard the Madleen. Please share our location. We’ll be sending the exact coordinates.\nAMY GOODMAN: In 2010, Israel conducted a deadly raid on another Gaza-bound aid ship, the Mavi Marmara. Israeli commandos stormed the boat in international waters, killing nine people. A 10th died after four years in a coma.\nFor more, we’re joined from the international waters by Greta Thunberg, the internationally renowned Swedish climate activist known for inspiring the global youth climate strike. In 2019, she received the Right Livelihood Award. She’s also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Greta is speaking to us aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla’s vessel Madleen, which is on this voyage from Sicily to Gaza, again, carrying lifesaving aid in an attempt to break Israel’s siege of the Gaza Strip.\nGreta, it’s really something to see you on that ship right now. Can you tell us why you’re taking this journey, extremely dangerous, and how you’re planning to challenge the Israeli blockade?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.\nYeah, as you said, we are doing this mission following one month after our last attempt. Boat Conscience was bombed and disabled. So, that’s why we are trying again, because we cannot afford to give up. There is simply too much at stake. And in times of injustice, as we are seeing now the genocide and blockade happening, we have to do everything we can to demand an end to these atrocities and war crimes committed by Israel.\nAnd for me personally, I happen to have a platform for some reason, and then it is my moral obligation to use that platform. And if my presence on this boat can make a difference, if that can show in any way that the world has not forgotten about Palestine, and to try once again to attempt to break the siege and open up a humanitarian corridor and deliver the extremely needed humanitarian aid, then that is a risk I am willing to take.\nAnd it’s something that we just simply have to do. We cannot just sit, sit around and do nothing and watch this like live-streamed genocide unfold in front of our very eyes. So we are doing this because we are human beings who care about justice. And when our complicit governments fail to step up, it falls on us, unfortunately, to do so.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Greta, could you talk about how you see the issue of Palestinian freedom connecting to or intersecting with the issue that you’re best known for, which is climate change activism?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah. For me, there is no way of distinguishing the two. We cannot have climate justice without social justice. The reason why I am a climate activist is not because I want to protect trees. I’m a climate activist because I care about human and planetary well-being, and those are extremely interlinked. For example, when we see the genocide in Gaza, of course, there are some very obvious links, that ecocide, environmental destruction is a very common method used in war and to oppress people.\nBut also, it should be much simpler than that. No matter what the cause of the suffering is, whether that is CO2, whether that is bombs, whether that is state repression or other forms of violence, we have to stand up against that source of suffering. And if we pretend to care about the environment, if we pretend to care about the climate and our children’s future, without seeing and acknowledging and fighting against the suffering of all marginalized people today, then that is an extremely racist approach to justice that excludes the majority of the world’s population.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what is the mood aboard the ship? You have participants from Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, and you yourself are Swedish. What’s the mood there?\nGRETA THUNBERG: The mood on board the ship is — I would say that our spirits are very high, and we are very determined to continue. So far, we have won over one of the major predicted obstacles, which is to be stuck in port due to the bureaucratic warfare that has been very strong, especially in the past. And the fact that we have gotten over that and that we are out sailing now and that we have gotten quite a far bit is already a victory in itself.\nAnd, of course, this mission is — includes many risks, and we have done many risk assessments. But, of course, we deem the risk of silence and the risk of inaction to be so much more deadly than this mission, of course. And we are 12 peaceful volunteers who are not carrying weapons. We are carrying food, medical supplies and sanitary products and other very needed humanitarian aid into Gaza following the blockade. And we will meet whatever is thrown at us with nonviolence in any scenario. So, we are trying to prepare and to maximize our safety and the success of this mission as much as we can.\nAMY GOODMAN: Greta, as you attempt to bring in baby formula, medical kits, flour, prosthetics for kids with amputations, the Israeli military has threatened to block the Freedom Flotilla. The Israeli army says it’s prepared to raid your ship. We know what happened to the Mavi Marmara with the Israeli raid and the killing of nine activists on board. Ultimately, a 10th died. So, are you seeing drones? How are you prepared to deal?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah, yeah, we are seeing drones. Last night, there were two different moments where there were drones circulating above us. And we are — we have safety procedures that we will use, and we have different scenarios that we are prepared for to try to maximize our safety in a nonviolent way. So, we are trying to do our very best. And it shows quite a bit that peaceful volunteers who are carrying humanitarian aid necessary for survival is being threatened to be raided, intercepted or attacked. I think that says quite a lot about the priorities and approaches of Israel right now.\nBut we must also remember that this mission is not about us. It is not about the voyage or the people on board. This mission is about Palestine. It is about the genocide, the occupation, ethnic cleansing and the other methods of war and oppression that are being used by Israel against the Palestinians. And we do not only need humanitarian aid to be let into Gaza. We do not only need a ceasefire. We need an end to the occupation.\nAMY GOODMAN: How do you plan to break the military blockade around Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Sorry. What did you say?\nAMY GOODMAN: How do you plan to break the military blockade around Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: We are planning to continue sailing until we cannot sail anymore. It is very difficult to predict what scenario it will be, but as far as we know, we are planning to continue, to continue as we are now.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what is your message to folks around the world, especially to young people who, throughout —\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah.\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: — the advanced countries, seem to have much more interest and dedication to ending the war in Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: My message is that right now international law is failing us. International institutions, our governments are failing us. Media, our companies are all failing us. Or “failing us” is a diplomatic way of saying that our system seems to be designed in a way that is built upon exploitation and oppression of people. And so, there’s no one to turn to. There’s no one we can turn to to rescue the situation, but it falls on us to step up, to continue flooding the streets, to continue organizing, boycotting, to speak up on all platforms to try to send a clear message that we will not stand for what is happening right now.\nAMY GOODMAN: According to Al Jazeera, Greta, they’re saying, according to flight radar, which tracks aircraft movements, an Israel-made Hellenic Coast Guard drone, IAI Heron UAV, hovered over the Madleen ship. The drone’s deployment was confirmed by the Greek Ministry of Defense. We’re speaking to you from the United States, where the —\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah.\nAMY GOODMAN: — South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on X, “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!” Your response?\nGRETA THUNBERG: We can swim very well. It says a lot about their priorities, that in the face of genocide and systematic starvation of 2 million people, lawmakers, elected officials, whose responsibility should be to serve the people and to protect the people, that they, rather than ending their complicity in genocide and the massive slaughtering of civilians, are focusing on mocking people who are at least trying to do their bit. I think that says everything we need to know about their priorities.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, your message to Palestinians who perhaps have read about or heard about your voyage, are awaiting your arrival? What is your message to them?\nGRETA THUNBERG: My message to them would be that we stand behind you in every step of the way. We are standing in solidarity with you. We see you. And I am also — my deepest apologies on behalf of the outside world, especially the Western world, that we continue to betray you and that more people are not stepping up. But I promise that at least we here will try our very best to stand up for you —\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Greta —\nGRETA THUNBERG: — as well, and to support you in your struggle.\nAMY GOODMAN: Greta, we wish you all safety. Greta Thunberg, internationally —\nGRETA THUNBERG: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: — renowned Swedish climate activist who inspired the global youth climate strike. She’s won the Right Livelihood Award, has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, was speaking to us aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla’s vessel Madleen, which is on a voyage from Sicily to Gaza carrying lifesaving aid in an attempt to break Israel’s siege of the Gaza Strip.

The boat, accompanied by Israel’s navy, arrived in Ashdod in the evening, according to Israel’s Foreign Ministry. It published a photo on social media of Thunberg after disembarking. The 12 activists were undergoing medical checks to ensure they are in good health, the ministry said. They were expected to be held at a detention facility in Ramle before being deported, according to Adalah, a legal rights group representing them. The activists had set out to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and its restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid. Both have put the territory of around 2 million Palestinians at risk of famine. WATCH: Former Israeli PM Olmert explains why he believes his country is committing war crimes The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the voyage, said the activists were “kidnapped by Israeli forces” while trying to deliver desperately needed aid. “The ship was unlawfully boarded, its unarmed civilian crew abducted and its life-saving cargo — including baby formula, food and medical supplies — confiscated,” it said in a statement. It said the ship was seized in international waters about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Gaza, and Adalah asserted that Israel had “no legal authority” to take it over. Israel’s Foreign Ministry portrayed the voyage as a public relations stunt, saying on social media that “the ‘selfie yacht’ of the ‘celebrities’ is safely making its way to the shores of Israel.” It said the activists would return to their home countries and the aid would be sent to Gaza through established channels. It circulated footage of what appeared to be Israeli military personnel handing out sandwiches and water to the activists, who were wearing life vests. Israel says boat was carrying minimal aid Israeli officials said the flotilla carried what amounted to less than a truckload of aid. “This wasn’t humanitarian aid. It’s Instagram activism,” Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. “Meanwhile, Israel has delivered over 1,200 truckloads in the last two weeks. So who’s really feeding Gaza and who’s really feeding their own ego? Greta was not bringing aid, she was bringing herself.” After its 2½-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers and experts have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive. About 600 trucks of aid entered daily during the ceasefire that Israel ended in March. An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after two drones attacked the vessel in international waters off Malta, organizers said. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the ship’s front section. Rights group questions Israel’s seizure A demonstrator releases colored smoke during a June 9 protest near the Israeli embassy in Athens, following the seizure by Israeli forces of the Gaza-bound charity vessel Madleen, operated by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters The Madleen set sail from Sicily a week ago. Along the way, it stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to avoid being detained by Libya’a coast guard. “I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,” Thunberg said in a prerecorded message released after the ship was halted. Adalah, the rights group, said in a statement that “the arrest of the unarmed activists, who operated in a civilian manner to provide humanitarian aid, amounts to a serious breach of international law.” Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, was among those on board. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. She was among six French citizens on board. French President Emmanuel Macron called for consular protection and the repatriation of the French citizens. “Most of all, France calls for a ceasefire as quickly as possible and the lifting of the humanitarian blockade. This is a scandal, unacceptable, that is playing out in Gaza. What’s been happening since early March is a disgrace, a disgrace,” Macron said Next week, Macron co-hosts a conference at the U.N. on a two-state solution and recently said France should move toward recognizing a Palestinian state. Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said the crew and passengers were aware of the risks, Swedish news agency TT reported. Stenergard said the ministry’s assessment is that no one was in danger and there was no need for consular support. An 18-year blockade on Gaza Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of a blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza’s Palestinian population. Israel sealed off Gaza from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas still holds 55 hostages, more than half believed to be dead. Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said that women and children make up most of the dead. The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the population, leaving people almost completely dependent on international aid. Efforts to broker another truce have been deadlocked for months. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas is defeated, or disarmed and exiled.

Speaking upon arrival in Paris en route to her home country of Sweden, Thunberg called for the release of the other activists who were detained aboard the Freedom Flotilla. She described a “quite chaotic and uncertain” situation during the detention. The conditions they faced “are absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now,” she said. The trip was meant to protest Israeli restrictions on aid to Gaza’s population of over 2 million people after 20 months of war, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the group behind the journey. Thunberg calls on supporters to mobilize “We were well aware of the risks of this mission,” Thunberg said. “The aim was to get to Gaza and to be able to distribute the aid.” She said the activists would continue trying to get aid to Gaza. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump called Thunberg “a young angry person” and recommended she take anger management classes. “I think the world need a lot more young angry women,” Thunberg said Tuesday in response. Thunberg said it appeared she was headed back to Sweden, hadn’t had access to a phone in a few days and wanted a shower. The activists were held separately and some had trouble accessing lawyers, she added. Asked why she agreed to deportation, she said, “Why would I want to stay in an Israeli prison more than necessary?” Thunberg called on supporters to ask their governments “to demand not only humanitarian aid being let into Gaza but most importantly an end to the occupation and an end to the systemic oppression and violence that Palestinians are facing on an everyday basis.” READ MORE: Gaza-bound aid boat with Greta Thunberg on board arrives in Israel after its seizure She said recognizing Palestine is “the very, very, very minimum” that governments can do to help.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, along with rights groups, said Israel’s actions in international waters were a violation of international law. Israel rejects that charge, saying such ships intend to breach what it argues is a lawful naval blockade of Gaza.

It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization’s greatest treasures — paralyzed in a strike by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries. WATCH: Why women are drawn to solo travel and how the tourism industry is responding Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei’s glass pyramid. “It’s the Mona Lisa moan out here,” said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. “Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.” The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world’s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own. Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols — a theatrical bid to “cool down” runaway tourism. The Louvre’s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called “untenable” working conditions. It’s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes — including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds. What’s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over — water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant. “We can’t wait six years for help,” said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. “Our teams are under pressure now. It’s not just about the art — it’s about the people protecting it.” The Mona Lisa’s daily mob At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa — a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des États, the museum’s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci’s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her — works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored. WATCH: The uncommon mastermind behind Mona Lisa’s smile “You don’t see a painting,” said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. “You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you’re pushed out.” Macron’s renovation blueprint, dubbed the “Louvre New Renaissance,” promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub. “Conditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,” Macron said in January. But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the €700–800 million million renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre’s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade — even as visitor numbers soared. “We take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,” Sefian said, “but when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.” While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited “masterpiece route” for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed. A museum in limbo The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year — more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid’s greenhouse effect. In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are “no longer watertight,” that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs — food, restrooms, signage — fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as “a physical ordeal.” “What began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,” Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre’s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year. But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.

            "Trump administration using no-bid contracts, boosting big firms, to get more ICE detention beds. By — Heather Hollingsworth, Associated Press Heather Hollingsworth, Associated Press By — John Hanna, Associated Press John Hanna, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-administration-using-no-bid-contracts-boosting-big-firms-to-get-more-ice-detention-beds Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Trump administration using no-bid contracts, boosting big firms, to get more ICE detention beds Nation Jun 16, 2025 11:07 AM EDT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) — Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly — in a building so storied that it inspired the term “the big house.” Now Kansas’ oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally. READ MORE: Trump administration seeks to turn mass deportations into an efficient business ‘like Amazon’ The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids. ICE has cited a “compelling urgency” for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida. That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge’s past description of the now-shuttered prison as “a hell hole.” The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president’s unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals. To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for “immigration enforcement support teams” to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety. Just last week, Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants — and earn $66 million in annual revenue. “Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders. A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation. Declaring an emergency to expedite contracts When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and — if private prison executives’ predictions are accurate — possibly to more than 150,000. ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without “Full and Open Competition.” Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE’s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan. WATCH: ‘We stand up for our neighbors,’ San Antonio mayor says of protests against ICE raids The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn’t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical. Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements. “I think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,” he said. A Kansas prison town becomes a priority CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE’s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast. “That would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,” said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center. Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth’s economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation’s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall. Resistance from Trump country The Leavenworth area’s politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president. But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn’t because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge issued an order requiring it earlier this month. An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service. In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were “false and defamatory.” Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017. “It was just mayhem,” recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples. The critics have included a federal judge When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson — an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican — who said of the prison: “The only way I could describe it frankly, what’s going on at CoreCivic right now is it’s an absolute hell hole.” WATCH: Investigation finds sexual assault claims against immigration officials routinely ignored The city’s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force’s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon. During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees’ experiences and said the company officials “do our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.” ICE moves quickly across the U.S. Besides CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans. ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it’s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention. Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that. ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren’t sought. WATCH: Georgia teen says ICE detention was ‘life-altering’ and ‘like a prison’ The Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes. The contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units “neighborhoods” and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly. The financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment. From idle prisons to a ‘gold rush’ Private prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump’s reelection in November, CoreCivic’s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo’s by 73%. “It’s the gold rush,” Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. “All of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you’re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.” Geo’s former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders. CoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger. CoreCivic officials said ICE’s letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing. Tiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is “placing a very dicey long-term bet” because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic “the keys to the treasury” without competition. But financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, “Great news.” “Are you hiding any more of them on us?” he asked.

(AP) — Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly — in a building so storied that it inspired the term “the big house.” Now Kansas’ oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally. READ MORE: Trump administration seeks to turn mass deportations into an efficient business ‘like Amazon’ The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids. ICE has cited a “compelling urgency” for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida. That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge’s past description of the now-shuttered prison as “a hell hole.” The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president’s unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals. To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for “immigration enforcement support teams” to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety. Just last week, Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants — and earn $66 million in annual revenue. “Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders. A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation. Declaring an emergency to expedite contracts When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and — if private prison executives’ predictions are accurate — possibly to more than 150,000. ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without “Full and Open Competition.” Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE’s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan. WATCH: ‘We stand up for our neighbors,’ San Antonio mayor says of protests against ICE raids The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn’t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical. Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements. “I think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,” he said. A Kansas prison town becomes a priority CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE’s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast. “That would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,” said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center. Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth’s economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation’s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall. Resistance from Trump country The Leavenworth area’s politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president. But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn’t because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge issued an order requiring it earlier this month. An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service. In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were “false and defamatory.” Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017. “It was just mayhem,” recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples. The critics have included a federal judge When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson — an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican — who said of the prison: “The only way I could describe it frankly, what’s going on at CoreCivic right now is it’s an absolute hell hole.” WATCH: Investigation finds sexual assault claims against immigration officials routinely ignored The city’s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force’s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon. During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees’ experiences and said the company officials “do our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.” ICE moves quickly across the U.S. Besides CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans. ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it’s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention. Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.

            "ICE is using no-bid contracts, boosting big firms, to get more detention beds. ICE is using no-bid contracts, boosting big firms, to get more detention beds\nNo-bid contracts with politically connected companies have become crucial to the Republican Trump administration’s push for more space to hold immigrants for deportation\nLEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) — Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly — in a building so storied that it inspired the term “the big house.”\nNow Kansas’ oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally.\nThe federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids.\nICE has cited a “compelling urgency” for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida.\nThat push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge’s past description of the now-shuttered prison as “a hell hole.\" The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president's unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals.\nTo get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for “immigration enforcement support teams” to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety.\nJust last week , Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants — and earn $66 million in annual revenue.\n“Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders.\nA tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.\nWhen Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and — if private prison executives' predictions are accurate — possibly to more than 150,000.\nICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without “Full and Open Competition.”\nOnly three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE’s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan.\nThe agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn’t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical.\nCharles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements.\n“I think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,” he said.\nCoreCivic's Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE’s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast.\n“That would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,” said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center.\nPrisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth's economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation’s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.\nThe Leavenworth area's politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president.\nBut skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn't because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge last week issued an order requiring it.\nAn attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service.\nIn late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were “false and defamatory.”\nVacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017.\n“It was just mayhem,” recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples.\nWhen Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson — an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican — who said of the prison: “The only way I could describe it frankly, what’s going on at CoreCivic right now is it’s an absolute hell hole.”\nThe city’s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force’s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes.\nThe facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon.\nDuring the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees' experiences and said the company officials “do our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.”\nBesides CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans.\nICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it’s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention.\nCounties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.\nICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren't sought.\nThe Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes.\nThe contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units “neighborhoods” and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly.\nThe financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn't respond to a request for comment.\nPrivate prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump’s reelection in November, CoreCivic’s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo’s by 73%.\n“It’s the gold rush,” Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. “All of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you’re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.”\nGeo's former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders.\nCoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger.\nCoreCivic officials said ICE's letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal.

            "NASA reconnects with interstellar Voyager 1 spacecraft using technology not used in decades. After a brief pause in communications with Voyager 1, NASA re-established a connection with the interstellar spacecraft located more than 15 billion miles away from Earth, using a frequency not used more than forty years.\nCommunication between NASA and Voyager 1 has been spotty at times. In fact, the spacecraft stopped sending readable data to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Nov. 14, 2023, and it was not until April that mission controllers began receiving commands once again.\nMore recently, the spacecraft turned off one of its two transmitters after what engineers suspected was due to Voyager 1’s fault protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard issues.\nFor instance, if the spacecraft uses too much power from its supply source, fault protection will kick in to conserve power by turning off non-essential systems, NASA explained.\nVOYAGER 1 DETECTS ‘HUM’ WHILE IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE: REPORT\nThe space agency said the flight team sent a command to activate one of the spacecraft’s heaters on Oct. 16. The command takes nearly 23 hours to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and then another 23 hours for the data to travel back.\nEngineers suspected Voyager 1 should have had plenty of power to operate the heather, though the fault protection system was triggered.\nOn Oct. 18, the team learned about the issue, because the Deep Space Network was unable to detect Voyager 1’s signal. Communication between NASA and the spacecraft occurs on the X-band radio transmitter, named for the frequency it uses.\nNASA PUBLISHES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS OF ‘RAVIOLI’ MOON ORBITING SATURN\nThe fault protection system lowered the rate the transmitter was able to send data back to NASA, engineers determined, therefore changing the X-band signal the Deep Space Network needed to listen for.\nOnce the signal was located, Voyager 1 appeared to be in a stable state and the team began investigating what happened.\nBut on Oct. 19, communication between the team and Voyager 1 stopped again, this time entirely.\nThe team believed Voyager 1’s fault protection system was triggered two more times and switched to a second radio transmitter called the S-band, which uses less power.\nNASA RE-ESTABLISHES COMMUNICATION WITH VOYAGER 1 INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT THAT WENT SILENT FOR MONTHS\nVoyager 1 had not used the S-band to communicate with Earth since 1981.\nEngineers with the Deep Space Network were ultimately able to detect the spacecraft’s communication from the S-band. Rather than risk turning the X-band back on before finding out what caused the fault protection system to trigger, the team sent a command on Oct. 22 to confirm the S-band transmitter was working.\nNow, the team is working to gather information to help them find out what happened so it can return Voyager 1 back to normal operations.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nVoyager 1′s odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system.\nAfter beaming back dazzling postcard views of Jupiter’s giant red spot and Saturn’s shimmering rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 used Saturn as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past Pluto.",

The Tokyo-based company ispace said its lander dropped out of lunar orbit as planned. But there was no immediate word on the outcome, following the hourlong descent. As the tension mounted, the company’s livestream of the attempted landing came to an abrupt end. “We haven’t been able to confirm,” one of the commentators said in Japanese, but Mission Control “will continuously attempt to communicate with the lander.” READ MORE: SpaceX Starship rocket tumbles out of control after launch The encore came two years after the company’s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name Resilience for its successor lander. Resilience holds a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist’s toy-size red house for placement on the moon’s dusty surface. Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way. Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March. Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon’s south pole and was declared dead within hours. Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less forbidding place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side’s northern tier. Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface. Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace’s European-built rover — named Tenacious — sports a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.

Takeshi Hakamada, CEO and founder of ispace, considers the latest moonshot “merely a steppingstone,” with its next, much bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement, and even more to follow. Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. “Engineers did everything they possibly could” to ensure success this time, he said.

            "To prevent ovarian cancers, fallopian tube removal is on the rise. To Rebecca Stone, the single most important fact about ovarian cancer is that it’s usually a misnomer. The most common kind — responsible for 70% of cases and 90% of deaths — often has its silent beginnings not in the ovary, but in the fallopian tube. This isn’t just an interesting factoid; as a gynecologic oncologist at Johns Hopkins, Stone sees it as a reason to evangelize. There’s no way to screen for so-called ovarian cancer, no colonoscopy, mammogram, or Pap smear equivalent. It’s typically found late, once it’s already spread. The treatments are middling at best. Among the best tools is surgical prevention: If someone doesn’t want more kids, and is considering another abdominal surgery, a surgeon can offer to take the tubes out.\nOpportunistic salpingectomy, it’s called. “Somebody says, ‘Can I get my tubes tied?’ And I will say, ‘Well, actually, we don’t tie tubes anymore, we remove them,’” said Greg Marchand, an OB-GYN in Mesa, Ariz. There are exceptions, but generally, since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended offering it in 2015, he’s gone with salpingectomy.\nYet if Stone feels the need to proselytize about it, it’s because she often meets doctors who don’t know about it. She remembers her surprise when she clicked into a virtual meeting in 2023 with medical bureaucrats whose jobs involve tracking diagnoses and interventions. “There were hundreds of people on this call, lots of them medical coders — people who are familiar with the development of new coding for new discoveries — and they had never heard of this. No one,” Stone said.\nConfusion abounded. Salpingectomies were documented as tubal ligations; patients didn’t know whether their tubes had been blocked off or completely removed. Beneath those ambiguities was a wonkier one. In the lexicon doctors use to chronicle and bill for their work, there were no medical codes specific to opportunistic salpingectomy.\nNow, after two years of advocating, Stone has convinced the committee behind the American diagnostic bible to create those codes. When they come into use in October, she hopes it will help clarify what patients are signing up for. That’s part of her mission: To give true consent, people need to understand the difference between these procedures — and the cancer risk that had set this whole change in motion to begin with.\nIt started in the 1990s, with a different kind of risk-reducing surgery. Geneticists had discovered that mutations in BRCA genes drastically increased the rates of certain tumors, mothers and aunts and sisters all born without a molecular tool for repairing damaged DNA, all dying of breast and ovarian cancer. For their surviving relatives, surgeons began offering to remove those tissues. It was invasive and awful, and in the case of ovaries, caused sudden menopause, which carried a host of complications. But it might just save their lives.\nPathologists, meanwhile, began examining the tissues that had been excised. If they could figure out where the tumors began, they might see how better to detect and treat them. The trouble was, they never found consistent precursors in the ovary. The cancers clung to its surface, but the seeds seemed to be coming from elsewhere. There was some hypothesizing that they emerged in the fallopian tube, but it seemed far-fetched. The tube was just a backdrop for the drama of fertilization, a mere conduit connecting uterus and ovary.\n“I came to a meeting probably around 2003, and I got up and said I didn’t think it happened,” said Christopher Crum, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He’d examined plenty of tubes in his time, and seen little to suggest that’s where cancers arose.\nBut then he started having second thoughts. Like others, he’d been examining a smidgen of the tube, cut from the middle. What if that were the wrong place? Each tube was 4 or 5 inches long, and wasn’t uniform. It was a widening flume with tentacle-like fringes at the end: a Dr. Seussian cross between a medieval trumpet and a sea anemone. Crum wondered what he would find if he sectioned and inspected the whole thing.\n“I wasn’t expecting to get knocked over,” he said — but within six weeks, he’d found five early cancers, mostly in the fringes he normally would have thrown away. In the previous decade, he hadn’t found any. Pathologists hadn’t seen anything in the tubes because they hadn’t truly been looking.\nThis wasn’t unique to people with BRCA mutations. The tubes of women with average cancer risk, it turned out, sometimes had potential precursors: cells that looked largely healthy but had telltale signs of DNA damage. Most wouldn’t go on to become cancers, but carried that sliver of a threat. When researchers in Vancouver examined the tubes of 12 consecutive ovarian cancer patients, they saw that threat borne out: Every single one had either those DNA-damaged cells, oncologist Dianne Miller recalled, “or the fallopian tube had been totally blown apart.”\nWhy so many cancers begin in the tube still isn’t entirely clear, but one hypothesis has to do with ovulation. The less often someone ovulates — because of pregnancy, say, or birth control pills — the lower their risk of ovarian cancer. It makes a certain kind of sense, given the DNA damage involved: “In order for that egg to kind of ooze or burst out of the ovary, it has to essentially erode some of the layers of the ovary itself,” explained Ronny Drapkin, a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe tasseled end of the fallopian tube hovers right there, draped over the ovary, ready to catch the egg and swish it toward potential fertilization, and, eventually, the uterus. It gets a repeated dose of the tissue-eroding chemical cocktail that allows for ovulation, and its cells may be less well equipped to deal with molecular injury than others.\nWhatever the cause, there was a growing consensus that most so-called ovarian cancers had a similar backstory. It started with quiet DNA damage going unrepaired in one fallopian tube, pushing cells into proliferating wildly, breaking free of the membrane they usually clung to for survival. Some migrated out to colonize the ovarian surface, and from there, spread further into the pelvic cavity. People with BRCA mutations were more susceptible, with the double whammy of normal wear and tear plus a faulty internal fix-it crew. But it happened in others, too. By the time the symptoms were noticeable, it was often too late.\nBy 2010, the idea of removing tubes was cemented in Miller’s mind. She was a gynecologic oncologist at the University of British Columbia, and knew that vast numbers of women got pelvic surgeries. For some, it was a hysterectomy to treat fibroids or heavy menstrual bleeding: removing the uterus, which connects to the tubes’ narrow ends. For others, it was a tubal ligation — colloquially, “tube-tying” — a sterilization procedure that involved severing, blocking, or clamping a tiny bit of the tube. To Miller, those surgeries were opportunities: a chance to remove cancer precursors before they arose.\nWhen her team looked at the medical records of British Columbians who’d had ovarian cancer, some 40% of them had previously had one of those operations. That represented thousands of potentially preventable cancers. “That was part of the impetus,” said Gillian Hanley, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia. “This was worth trying, because people were so tired of watching women die from ovarian cancer. They were willing to try anything.”\nSo began a province-wide campaign, with Miller asking surgeons to suggest salpingectomy to anyone considering either hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Ovarian cancer is rare enough — and often occurs late enough in life — that it would take years to see any statistically meaningful decrease in cases. In the meantime, opportunistic salpingectomy started taking root. The Canadian society representing gynecologic oncologists recommended offering it in 2011. The American equivalent did the same in 2013. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists got on board two years later.\nAlready, there were hopeful data. In Sweden, researchers dug through decades of records of tubes excised for other reasons: an abscess, an ectopic pregnancy. Those who’d had both tubes removed had half the ovarian cancer risk of those who’d had only one tube out, as if the surgery were a preventive drug, more effective in its full dose.\nMiller and Hanley’s results, when they came in 2022, suggested the same thing. If the nearly 26,000 British Columbians who’d opted for opportunistic salpingectomy had gotten the most common and deadliest form of ovarian cancer at the same rate as the control group — who’d kept their tubes — there should have been at least five cases. Instead, there were zero.\nThis wasn’t just an artifact of salpingectomy-choosers smoking less, exercising more, and being less cancer-prone overall. Their rates of breast and colorectal tumors were the same as the control group’s. Rather, though it sounded drastic to some, opportunistic salpingectomy seemed like a potential boon for public health.\nLook at the uptake statistics, and you might be surprised at Stone’s quest to publicize salpingectomy. There’s already been a massive increase. From 2010 to 2017, among Americans with private insurance, salpingectomy rates jumped 18-fold during sterilizations and 8-fold during non-cancer-related hysterectomies. When STAT asked medical records giant Epic’s research arm for more recent data on tubal removals replacing tube-tying, the company reported that there were 115 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2015, and 332 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2024.\nBut Stone was worried about what lurked behind those crisp-seeming numbers. Epic Research reported running into the same issues. In some cases, it was impossible to know whether a patient had gotten a tubal ligation or a salpingectomy.\nPartially, it was a question of translation. To get reimbursed, American doctors report what happened in a clinical encounter using two different codes, one describing the diagnosis, the why of the visit, and another describing the services rendered, what they did about it. But certain “what” codes didn’t distinguish between ligating a small bit of the tube and removing the organ entirely, and there were no “why” codes that captured some patients’ cancer-prevention rationale when going in for another surgery.\nThis being the United States, the problem is exacerbated by insurance hurdles. Some state Medicaid programs explicitly won’t pay for salpingectomy for sterilization purposes; some private insurers deny those claims, too. The National Women’s Law Center estimates that its contraception coverage hotline gets about 20 to 25 intakes a week, and three quarters of them are about issues with salpingectomy.\nThe very thing that makes it alluring to doctors and patients alike — permanent contraception and cancer prevention in one fell swoop — doesn’t compute in insurer-speak. “The insurer will be like, ‘We can’t cover it, because this is not a preventive code. We’ll cover it if your doctor changes it to a preventive code.’ And so they go to their doctor, and their doctor is like, ‘I can’t change it, I coded it correctly,’” explained Lauren Wallace, a lawyer at the center. “It’s an absolute mess.”\nThere’s also evidence of deliberate fudging, patients counseling each other on Reddit to ask their doctors to perform salpingectomies but code them as tubal ligations, to get around insurance denials.\nOn the flip side, some patients don’t know exactly what surgery they’ve gotten until after the fact. Tonya Gegenheimer, a bail bond agent and mother of three in Monrovia, La., only discovered she no longer had any tubes when she contacted a surgeon about getting her tubal ligation reversed, an operation that involves suturing the severed ends of the tube back together. “I was asked to get my operative and pathology report, and when I brought that to my appointment, he said, ‘Unfortunately, you’re not a candidate for reversal. They removed everything,’” Gegenheimer said. “That was not what I wanted. That was not the terminology that I agreed upon. I was very distraught.”\nShe is part of an online community of patients who’ve experienced a constellation of debilitating symptoms — abdominal pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, mood swings, brain fog — after a tubal ligation or salpingectomy, and can’t shake the feeling that this mysterious syndrome was caused by the sterilization. Though it doesn’t always work to restore fertility, which is the primary reason doctors offer it, to these patients, reversal is a way to potentially ease their symptoms. You can’t reverse a tubal removal, though, and some worry about the trend toward salpingectomy.\nThey know that the syndrome they describe is controversial, and often dismissed by doctors: There’s robust safety data on both sterilization procedures, and the complication rates are low. But what this community wants, besides recognition and relief, is more in-depth consent, such that patients know in greater detail — and in advance — what each surgery involves.\nStone wants that, too. She’s often appalled at how poorly doctors explain procedures to patients, how often women know they’ve had a hysterectomy but aren’t sure whether they still have ovaries or tubes, how often they know they’ve had a “sterilization” but aren’t sure what exactly that means. So, in 2023, she proposed new “why” codes for opportunistic salpingectomy. She hoped it might boost insurance coverage, but also knowledge about the procedure beyond OB-GYNs. “The most real things in medicine are the things you can bill for,” she said. “It doesn’t matter how great the discovery is. If people can’t access this cancer prevention, you’re dead in the water.”\nNow, after two years of work, those codes will be published in the coming weeks, and come into use in October. Doctors will have the bureaucratic terminology to convey the distinction between these operations to insurers — and Stone is gearing up for more campaigning, so that that distinction gets transmitted not just in code but in plain English (and other languages), too. She wants patients to know that salpingectomy can significantly reduce the risk of certain ovarian cancers, but doesn’t eliminate it entirely. There are subtypes that begin elsewhere. There could be rare instances in which a tube is removed after a mutated cell has already floated out of the tasseled opening and seeded itself on the outside of the ovary.\nThere are other places this procedure could go. Research is underway to understand if it might protect BRCA-mutation carriers against so-called ovarian cancers, allowing some to avoid the sudden menopause that comes with ovary removal. For now, though, Stone mostly wants patients to know what’s in the most basic names their doctors bandy about. That “ovarian cancer” isn’t always as ovarian as it sounds. That “sterilization” can mean different things. Only then, can patients actually choose.",

A rare type of cancer is growing among millennials and members of Generation X, new research shows.\nDiagnoses of appendix cancer have tripled in the U.S. for people born between 1976 and 1984 — and it has quadrupled for those born between 1981 and 1989.\nThe study was published on Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\nCOMMON MENOPAUSE MEDICATION MIGHT PREVENT BREAST CANCER WHILE TREATING HOT FLASHES\nResearchers from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program to arrive at these findings.\n\"When you take these alarming rates that we are seeing for appendiceal cancer across generations, together with the fact that one in every three patients diagnosed with appendiceal cancer is diagnosed under the age of 50, these point to a timely need for everyone to be aware of the signs and symptoms of appendix cancer,\" said lead author Andreana Holowatyj, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, in a press release from the university.\nFDA APPROVES FIRST AI TOOL TO PREDICT BREAST CANCER RISK\nCancer of the appendix is rare, affecting only about one or two people per million each year in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

            "Celebrity breast cancer announcements highlight rising rates in young women. Several young celebrities have announced breast cancer diagnoses in the past year — a public reminder that rates are rising among women under 50 in the U.S.\nPop singer Jessie J, 37, revealed last week on Instagram that she has early-stage breast cancer and plans to undergo surgery this month. Katie Thurston, former star of “The Bachelorette,” has documented her journey with Stage 4 breast cancer on social media after being diagnosed this year at age 34. And actor Danielle Fishel, known for her role on the ’90s sitcom “Boy Meets World,” revealed her diagnosis at age 43 to fans last summer.\nNew breast cancer diagnoses in young women have gone up considerably in the last decade. From 2012 to 2021 — the most recent decade of data — the rate increased 1.4% annually in women under 50, compared with 0.7% annually in women 50 and up.\nThe trend applies to all racial or ethnic groups, particularly Asian American and Pacific Islander women under 50, for whom diagnoses have risen nearly 50% since 2000. Black women have the highest rate of breast cancer before age 40 and are most likely to die of the disease.\nWomen under 40 generally aren’t advised to get mammograms unless they have a strong risk factor for breast cancer, such as a family history or genetic mutation. In that case, the American Cancer Society recommends mammograms starting at age 30, plus an annual breast MRI.\nSeveral breast cancer doctors said younger patients and their clinicians should be careful not to dismiss symptoms such as a lump or nipple discharge.\n“The thought was always, if you had a change in your breast but you were a young woman, it was probably nothing,” said Dr. Rani Bansal, an assistant professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. “As we’re seeing more and more younger women get diagnosed … we need to take these cases seriously.”\nDr. Oluwadamilola Fayanju, chief of breast surgery at Penn Medicine, said her youngest patient diagnosed with cancer was just 17. She recommended that young women with symptoms go to a center that’s experienced in breast imaging.\nFor women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, she said, “it may be better for you to be connected with a dedicated breast provider who can keep a close eye on you and do regular exams even well before 40.”\nBreast cancer in young women is often more aggressive\nAs treatment options for breast cancer have improved, the overall mortality rate among younger women with the disease declined from 2010 to 2020, according to research presented in April at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Chicago.\nBut young women are still more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared with older women. One reason could be that they’re not getting screened as much, so it’s harder to catch cases early. Young women are also more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, which tends to spread fast and has fewer treatment options.\nDr. Virginia Borges, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, said all women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35 have a higher likelihood of the cancer spreading to the rest of their bodies, for reasons doctors don’t fully understand.\n“It’s like this great big puzzle of all these different factors that can contribute to why we see these cancers behave the way they do,” Borges said.\nBansal said doctors are hoping to learn more about which treatments are better suited to women under 50.\n“We need more data to better tailor our treatments towards younger women,” she said. “A lot of the studies that are done are in older women.”\nLifestyle, environment, hormones\nThere are several mysteries as to why younger women are diagnosed with breast cancer at higher rates. Doctors generally agree that multiple factors are at play, including lifestyle, hormones and environmental exposures.\nDiets high in ultra-processed foods or a lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, which in turn elevates one’s cancer risk. Women in their 30s and 40s have also increased their alcohol consumption in recent decades, and drinking alcohol is linked to breast cancer.\nExposure to environmental toxins such as air pollution, forever chemicals or microplastics could also play a role.\n“By the time women now in their 40s were babies, every single baby bottle had BPA. Everyone had Teflon pans in their home. Everyone was spraying Scotchgard around their home,” said Suzanne Price, CEO of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, a nonprofit that works to eliminate exposure to toxic chemicals.\nSeveral researchers said more data is needed to definitively draw that link.\n“Hopefully within the next few years, we should be having more insight into how those early life exposures drive the risk of breast cancer,” said Dr. Adetunji Toriola, a professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine.\nSome studies have suggested that chemical hair straighteners, which are predominantly used by Black women, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Fayanju said the straighteners “can potentially have effects on our ability to process hormones in our body and how those hormones then interact with cells in our breasts, which have receptors for those hormones.”\nChanges in women’s reproductive lives might have some effect as well.\nGirls in the U.S. are starting their periods slightly earlier in life compared with decades ago. That may increase how long they’re exposed to higher levels of estrogen — a hormone that in some cases can feed cancer cells. A study last year found an increase in the number of women ages 20 to 49 diagnosed with breast cancer that was responsive to estrogen.\nMany women are also delaying childbirth until their 30s and 40s, which increases the risk of postpartum breast cancer — cancers that occur within five to 10 years of giving birth that appear to be linked to changes in the breasts during that time. Borges estimated that there are 18,000 new cases of postpartum breast cancer each year.\n“How do you get from the millions of women who are having children without ending up with one of these breast cancers to the 18,000 or so who are going to get one of these breast cancers?” she said. “We’re still working on figuring that out. Age is important.”"
